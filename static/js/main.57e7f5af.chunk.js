They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\\nSample Topic Schedule\\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\\n1.

We will also explore important technical and theoretical concepts associated with the moving image, such as editing, dialectic, representation, and protest. We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage. A core component of these assessments will be presentation and engagement on critique days.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nDemonstrate a basic understanding of the video making process.\\nDevelop comprehension of non-linear editing concepts and practical competency in the usage of non-linear video-editing software. \\nDevelop skills in basic script writing format and an understanding of filmic narrative structure.\\nDemonstrate competency in oral presentation and studio critique.\\nAcquire introductory knowledge of seminal video artworks and experimental films.\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance and Participation:15%\\nVideo Project, Individual: One video with duration of less than 5-minutes made using only found footage. 30%\\nPresentation and critique session for 5-minute video. 10%\\nFinal video project, Individual: One final video with duration of less than 10 minutes, using footage shot by the student. 35%\\nPresentation and critique session for 10-minute video final project. 10%","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}]},{"title":"Special Topics in Contemporary Art: Post-Asia","id":"ARTS301_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Pamela Corey","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NgQAJ/arts301fall2021s01","description":"Faculty: Pamela Corey - E: pamela.corey@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite or Co-requisite: ARTS101 \u2013 Introduction to Visual Studies.

Instead of geographically mapping these practices and artists by nation or region, we will examine selected case studies and specific artworks through such thematic and conceptual topics as the Body, Painting, Technology, Archive, Scale, and Voice. What this structuring offers is a way of understanding contemporary art as intellectually conditioned, transnationally networked, and as something embedded in both national and global economic and political developments. In addition, close examination of individual artists and artworks will afford us a deeper understanding of how Asian artists have navigated and continue to navigate the specificities of local histories, sensorial encounters with changing materials, forms, and sites, and the complexities of identity and belonging. Today, as we progress further into what has been projected to be \'the Asian century\', the term \u2018Post-Asia\u2019 thus encourages us to think about the changing context and imagination of Asia as it informs critical analyses and representations of contemporary art in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and offers modes of resisting cultural tropes problematically rooted in the \u2018East vs West\u2019 binary.\\nThis introductory course is required for all Art and Media Studies majors.

This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives\\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\\n---\\nCourse Materials:\\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas.

Through the Fulbright Scholar Development program, these students will earn 4 credits, equivalent to one full-time course, as they complete this academic internship. \\nThese student scholars will engage in a variety of tasks and activities intended to provide them with a holistic academic experience. Much of the experience will revolve around the delivery of the course Principles of Economics I. Student scholars will create materials, support lectures, run tutorials, aid with experiments, and participate in weekly meetings and online discussions.  \\nIn addition to running this course with Graeme, student scholars will also have the opportunity to develop their own research ideas based on lessons from the course. For each topic covered in Principles of Economics I, student scholars will be given additional readings and resources intended to deepen their knowledge on the topic and provoke research ideas. \\nAt the end of the Fall term, student scholars will submit either a literature review or project proposal. Student scholars will also have to complete a reflection on the experience. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: By the end of the Fall term, student scholars will be able to:\\n\u2022 clearly communicate theoretical and methodological approaches to economic issues\\n\u2022 use strategies and instructional methods to effectively lead small groups in discussions and activities\\n\u2022 formulate research questions founded in economic theory\\n\u2022 evaluate and test theoretical models\\n\u2022 analyze and interpret experimental data\\n---\\nExpected Workload:\\nStudent scholars will begin working with Graeme during the week of September 27, 2021 to help prepare for the delivery of the course Principles of Economics I. From the week of September 27 to October 15, student time will be divided between meetings, workshops, and course set-up as follows:\\nMeetings (2 hrs/week): Meetings during these three weeks will be devoted to getting organized and checking in on progress with activities related to setting up the course. Each week there will be a one-hour meeting with all students as well as meetings with sub-groups of students working on different aspects of the course.\\nWorkshops (2 hrs/week): Each week we will hold a two-hour teaching workshop where students will lead portions of lessons or activities that they have helped develop. During these sessions, all students will participate and Graeme will provide feedback on the delivery of the lessons/activities. The goal of these workshops is to help students become comfortable leading small groups through online activities.\\nCourse Set-up (6 hrs/week): Student scholars may be asked to update slides, create reading lists, develop homework documents, and set-up Canvas. Student scholars will be assigned various topics from the course and asked to work either individually or in small groups to ensure all materials needed for the course are ready before the Fall term begins. Once the Fall term begins, from the week of October 17, 2021 until January 14, 2022, student scholars will be spend their time in class, meetings, office hours, and on research-related activities, as follows:\\nClass Time (3 hrs/week): Principles of Economics I will have class on Monday and Wednesday. Each session will run for 90 minutes. Monday\u2019s session will be run by Graeme while Wednesday\u2019s session will be primarily run by student scholars as tutorials. These tutorials will primarily address the weekly homework, but may also involve discussion-based activities that student scholars will facilitate.\\nMeetings (2 hr/week): We will meet once per week for two hours. During this time we will debrief on the week\u2019s lecture and tutorial, prepare for the following week\u2019s lesson, and discuss the related literature on the coming topics.\\nOffice Hours (1 hr/week): Each student scholar will be required to hold one office hour per week. During these times, students from Principle of Economics I can ask questions related to their weekly homework.\\nResearch (4 hrs/week): Each week, student scholars will engage in research activities related to a topic from the coming lesson. The goal is to give the student scholar a deeper understanding of some of the research on a specific topic. For example, in the second week we will discuss capitalism as an economic system. The specific research we may investigate could be based on studies comparing contemporary economic behaviour in the former countries of East and West Germany.\\nWeekly research activities may include, but are not limited to, constructing bibliographies, engaging in online discussion groups, presenting readings, and analyzing data. Online discussion groups will allow student scholars to collaborate on weekly research topics to organize readings and share important findings. Student scholars may be asked to present some of what they have learned during weekly meetings.\\nBy the end of the week of January 14, 2022, student scholars will have to submit either a project proposal or literature review as well as a reflection.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading: Pass/No Pass","categories":["EL"],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Modern East Asia","id":"HIS104_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Mark Frank","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NiQAJ/his104fall2021s01","description":"Faculty: Mark Frank - E: mark.frank@fulbright.edu.vn \\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No.\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\nCross-listed: History (HIS), Vietnamese Studies (VS)\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course covers East Asian History from 1600 to the present with a focus is on the tumultuous 19th and 20th centuries, when China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam underwent rapid social and political transformations in response to unprecedented internal and external pressures. Our goal is to develop a deep understanding of key historical \u2018moments\u2019, such as the Opium War and the Meiji Restoration, and the ability to situate those moments in the greater context of East Asian history. Lectures will be broad in scope while readings will be more narrowly focused. The course format will alternate between lecture and open-ended discussion. The course is structured in four major units as follows:\\nUnit 1: East Asian Order from 1600-1839\\nUnit 2: Crisis and Adaptation (1839-1895)\\nUnit 3: A New Balance of Power (1895-1945)\\nUnit 4: Rebuilding after World War II (1945-present)\\nLearning Objectives: Students will develop knowledge, skills, and mindsets as follows:\\nKnowledge: Students will develop a broad understanding of the contours of modern East Asian history and a deep understanding of certain events and figures.\\nSkills: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources as well as between scholarly and non-scholarly sources, and they will develop an ability to critically evaluate texts by referring to other sources and by drawing on the knowledge they acquire in this course.\\nMindsets: Students will contemplate past ways of thinking about morality, politics, and religion in East Asia in order to make sense of the region\'s history.

Like many of the explorers you will meet along the way, you will travel across time from when Chinggis Khan\u2019s armies conquered China and Baghdad in the 13th century and the Black Death scoured the Eurasian world a century later right up to the globalization of our day. Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age? How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. The aim of this course is to understand the big forces that pull the world\u2019s parts together as well as those that drive them apart. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects you to students elsewhere in the world. Across 22 locations around the world, students are taking the same course simultaneously and posting and sharing their ideas on the course Gallery site.\\n---\\nLectures: All lectures are pre-recorded and online. Two weekly lectures will be posted every Friday night at 22:00 EDT on Canvas. You must watch these lectures BEFORE your weekly team meeting. Each lecture is about an hour long.

It has left no one untouched. It has disrupted national economies, global supply chains and international travel. It has sharply exposed social, economic and political inequity around the world. It has upended international norms of behaviour and highlighted the inadequacy of global institutions to promote sound health policies to protect the most vulnerable and effectively stop the spread of the virus. This is a problem-based, interdisciplinary social sciences course that addresses these issues and sets out to answer the question: What lessons can the global community learn from the Covid-19 pandemic? Over the duration of this course, students will work together to answer this question, watching short video presentations online, doing weekly readings and engaging in synchronous and asynchronous online learning activities and discussions with the instructor and their fellow classmates. In doing so, students will collaboratively seek solutions to the inter- and transnational problems that have emerged from the pandemic such as: What is the proper balance to strike between saving lives and saving the economy? How can the global community address the social, economic and political inequality that has made the effects of the pandemic so much worse for certain populations in the world? How can global institutions be strengthened to promote international cooperation and effective health policies to prevent future pandemics?\\n---\\n Learning Outcomes: On completion of this course, you will be able to:\\nDefine the social, economic and political challenges faced by the global community during the Covid-19 pandemic\\nExplain how international institutions responded to the Covid-19 pandemic\\nIdentify the social, economic and political lessons learned by the global community from the Covid-19 pandemic\\nPropose global policies to address the health and welfare problems posed by future pandemics\\nClearly articulate your ideas in written and oral form\\n---\\nClass Schedule:\\nLearning Materials\\nVideo presentations \u2013 YouTube and other online videos assigned by the instructor or identified by students investigating and issue.\\nWeb-based material assigned by the instructor or identified by students investigating an issue.\\nReadings \u2013 articles and chapters found online or posted by the instructor as well as material identified by students investigating and issue.\\nWeek 1:\\nIntroduction to the Course: Defining the Problem\\nAs a class we will meet to determine a strategy to determine the lessons to be learned from the Covid-19 Pandemic.

The course starts with pre-modern and early modern theorists from East and West like Thucydides, Confucius, Machiavelli, Grotius, Kant, and Hobbes. We go on to explore the development of the first modern International Relations theories at the turn of the 20th century, including Marxism, Classical Liberalism, Classical Realism. We then retrace how Neo-Liberalism and Neo-Realism fought for dominance during the Cold War. Finally, we get to the present era where Critical Theory, Constructivism, Neo-Functionalism, and Intergovernmentalism are now challenging older paradigms and bringing new voices to the International Relations debate. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be introduced to the most influential International Relations theories.\\nStudents will apply their knowledge of the historical, socio-political, and personal context behind the development of International Relations theories to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each school of thought.\\nStudents will apply this knowledge to analyze present-day problems in international relations.\\nStudents will develop critical thinking and argumentative writing skills to synthesize their own philosophy of international relations.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule & Readings:\\nRecommended background reading, especially for students unfamiliar with world history: Paul Kennedy, Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\\nWeek#: Introduction\\nIntroduction to the course\\nWeek#: Confucius and Mencius in pre-imperial China\\nHow did the political fragmentation of China during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period shape Confucius\u2019 and Mencius\u2019 ideas about inter-state relations?\\nYuri Pines, Foundations of Confucian Thought, Introduction, Chapter 4\\nDavid Kang, \u201cHierarchy and Legitimacy in International Systems: The Tribute System in Early Modern East Asia\u201d; Sungmoon Kim, \u201cMencius on International Relations and the morality of war: From the perspective of Confucian \u2018Moralpolitik\u2019\u201d\\nWeek#: Thucydides in Classical Greece\\nDid Thucydides really believe in \u201cThucydides\u2019 Trap\u201d?\\nGraham Allison, \u201cThe Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China Headed for War?\u201d https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/; James Lee, \u201cDid Thucydides Believe in Thucydides\u2019 Trap?\u201d\\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, Chapters I-V, XVII-XVIII, XXIII https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7142/7142-h/7142-h.htm\\nWeek#: Machiavelli in the Italian Renaissance\\nTo what extent was Machiavelli \u201cMachiavellian\u201d?\\nJames Hankins, Virtue Politics: Soulcraft and Statecraft in Renaissance Italy, Chapters I-III\\nNiccol\xf2 Machiavelli, The Prince https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm; Discourses on Livy, Book II http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10827/pg10827-images.html\\nWeek#: Grotius vs. Selden in the Age of Discovery\\nHow did imperial rivalry in the 17th century shape the foundations of the modern Law of the Sea?\\nPeter Borschberg, \u201cThe Seizure of the Sta.

Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at \u201ctrials\u201d real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and \u201cshow\u201d trials, trials of terrorists and \u201ccounter-terrorists,\u201d as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe\u2019s changing political landscape.\\n\u201cEurope on Trial\u201d is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans\u2014the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma. Students taking this course will witness how and why Europeans have constantly reexamined their past. In so doing, they will better understand Europe\u2019s present and gain a framework for analyzing more universal questions of balancing order with civil liberties, justice, and power beyond the European continent. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUnderstand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Europe since 1945.\\nCompare and contrast how various postwar European political and legal systems deployed the law to address issues of justice, security, democracy, religion, and historical memory.\\nAnalyze critically visual, textual, literary, legal, and archival documentation.\\nEvaluate primary and secondary sources to address fundamental questions of historical change in Europe since 1945.\\nCraft evidence-based argumentation through written assignments that address the historical role of political systems on law and law on political systems in Europe since the end of the Second World War.\\n---\\nCourse Outline: Link\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\n1.

These include intimate relationships, sexuality, leadership, work, teams, environmental problems, popular culture, body image, digital gaming, social media, addiction and the conflict between traditional values and modern lifestyles. These topics will be explored in relation to our sense of self and identity, social interactions, intergroup relationships, how people develop knowledge of the world and the situated nature of human existence. The course assumes that social psychology is more than a spectator sport by making links between theory, research and action. Guiding such work is the proposition that human beings have innate dignity and should be afforded equitable chances to flourish in life.\\n---\\nSyllabus\\nSession 01: Introduction to Applied Social Psychology\\nReadings:\\nHodgetts, D., Stolte, O., Sonn, C., Drew, N., Carr, S., & Nikora, L.

It begins by examining what means to represent (literally, re-present) or \u201ctell about\u201d social life, the various ways this has been and can be done, and the challenges we face in doing so in a way that brings value to the social settings and relations within which we work and live. It does so first by examining and comparing various genres of social representation and then distinguishing the social sciences as a distinctive if internally diverse set of approaches to understanding aspects of \\"society\\" or social life. To do this, the course offers a comparative introduction to traditions of social inquiry spanning the fields of sociology, political economy, economics, \\"political science,\\" and anthropology. Finally, the course considers the value and limitations of single-discipline only approaches to understanding the social world and the promise and challenges of a more transdisciplinary approach.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to: \\nExplain in generic terms what it means to \u201ctell about\u201d or \u201crepresent\u201d \u201csociety.\u201d\\nDistinguish social sciences from other genres of social representation.\\nMake distinctions among major traditions of inquiry and ideas in the social sciences.\\nGenerate questions and analyze issues from different disciplinary perspectives.\\nBring multiple social scientific and other perspectives on a social issue of interest. \\n---\\nCourse Outline\\n1.

Ethnography refers to both a process of doing ethnography and a written product. In doing ethnography, a researcher actively participates in the group in order to gain an insider\u2019s perspective of the group and to have experiences similar to the group members. In writing ethnography, a researcher narrates observations of the group based on this participation, interviews with group members, and an analysis of group documents and artifacts. This course is designed to provide students with an overview of ethnography and the ethnographic research process, including formulating research questions, finding sources and data, evaluating and critiquing qualitative data including field notes and interview transcripts, and writing an ethnographic report. The course explores crucial aspects of preparing for, realizing and evaluating ethnographic fieldwork.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\nAppraise the quality of ethnographic research;\\nAppreciate the role personal and theoretical knowledge play in conducting ethnographic research;\\nComprehend the way ethnographic data is collected and interpreted; and,\\nWrite and present ethnographic research reports.\\n---\\nAssessments:\\nClass participation (20%)\\nMidterm quiz/exam (20%)\\nResearch Project Presentation (10%)\\nResearch findings presentations (20%)\\nFinal essay (30%)","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}]},{"title":"Foundations of Political Economy","id":"SOCI201_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Jonathan London","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NtQAJ/soci201fall2021s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Jonathan London - E: TBA\\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: Online\\nCross-listed: Social Sciences (SOCI), Economics (ECON)\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course provides students a rigorous introduction to key ideas, concepts, theories, and problems in classical and contemporary political economy and demonstrates their value for exploring, understanding, and explaining economies and economic aspects of social life in a variety of settings. Drawing on a sociological approach, the course emphasizes political economy\u2019s social foundations and seeks to equip students with the ideas and skills needed to develop an informed analysis of some the most important social, political, economic, and cultural debates of our times. Rather than endorsing any one perspective on economy and society, the course surveys and combines multiple perspectives, drawing from ideas and concepts from various intellectual traditions spanning the fields of economics, sociology, politics, and anthropology. The course explores the strengths and weaknesses of these various traditions. In doing so, the course invites students to appreciate that, whatever our preferred explanatory frame or favored theory may be, no single perspective or intellectual standpoint is likely to be wholly sufficient for understanding or explaining actually existing economies. Rather than dwelling on abstractions, the course addresses real world problems and themes.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nExplain key concepts and theoretical approaches in classical, contemporary political economy.\\nDevelop comparative perspectives on course themes addressed in a variety of settings.\\nCollect and use data to make or explore claims about variety of political economy themes.\\nCompare features of Vietnam\u2019s economy with other countries in the region and the world.\\n---\\nCourse Outline:\\n1.

One can wake up, grab their phone, catch up with news and friends from around the world, all before leaving the bed. For all humans spending their lives in towns, villages, and cities, from one side of the world to another, most of us spend much of our lives in cyberspace. The meaning of \u201cgoing there\u201d has changed, and the Internet is fundamental to that change. We log into the Internet, go online, visit websites, surf the web, navigate pages, and so forth. Even the language we use to talk about the Internet is one of travel, of spatial belonging and exploration. This course considers how the Internet, and in particular, online communities and cyberspace are redefining what it means to be human. As much as this is a course about digital belonging, this is also a course of digital belonging. Through a reflexive analysis of our digital connectivity within the class, we can challenge our own assumptions about what it means to exist in digital spaces. Some online spaces we will explore are Social Media Influencers, E-Sports, Online Forums (including parenting, suicide, and dating), Hacktivism, Wikipedia, and, of course, Facebook. Some theoretical concepts we explore are social theories of modernization, materiality, actor network theory, social capital, identity, space, virtuality, the state, and surveillance. This course offers a general introduction to social science and anthropological research methods, and theories, with a specific emphasis on cultures of and in new media (internet, mobile phone, etc.). As a final project, students will develop and conduct a mini-ethnography of an online community of their choosing.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: By the end of this class, students will be able to:\\nDesign and produce an ethnographic text through writing a mini-ethnography which includes a literature review section\\nApply qualitative anthropological methods to analyze communication and community over new media.\\nUnderstand core concepts in digital anthropology\\nSelect, read, and synthesize secondary sources based on research interests\\nReflect upon their own online experiences and identity formation.\\n---\\nReading Guides\\nReading guides are available to help you work with these texts. They are optional but highly recommended.

A prevailing perception regards Asian women \u2013 especially those highly educated or from powerful families \u2013 as socio-politically as well or even better than their male counterparts. Yet there is little understanding of the history, nature, and challenge of Asian women\u2019s struggle to exercise their political agency. This course offers students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of women and politics in Asia and to explore the significance of gender in politics of the past, present, and future. The course also examines various factors, trajectories and outcomes of women\u2019s political advancement in contemporary Asia. This course aims to familiarize students with a broad range of issues involving women and politics in Asia \u2013 the political participation of women; the history of women\u2019s movements; political divisions among women; and what we mean when we refer to \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d at home, at work, and in political institutions. Because women\u2019s involvement in the political arena is informed by their roles and status at home and in society at large, the course will also examine sociological, anthropological, and feminist research on such topics as inequality, power, discrimination, and social norms. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning women in Vietnam and Asia.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\nComprehend various institutional, cultural and personal factors, as well as distinctive trajectories and outcomes of women\u2019s political engagement in Vietnam and Asia;\\nUse basic concepts and theories of women and politics;\\nRead critically the literature and other materials;\\nWrite and present academic research reports; and,\\nReflect upon women in politics and society of Vietnam and Asia.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nClass participation (20%)\\nMidterm quiz/exam (20%)\\nResearch Project Presentation (10%)\\nResearch findings presentations (20%)\\nFinal essay (30%)","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"}]},{"title":"Cultural and Intellectual Foundation of Vietnamese Literary Chinese 1","id":"VS106a_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Phan Thu Van","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NyQAJ/vs106afall2021s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Phan Thu Van - E: van.phan@fulbright.edu.vn \\nLevel: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course helps Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems.

It seeks to examine different theoretical perspectives on social movements and meanwhile exposes students to empirical studies of movements across the world, in both democratic and non-democratic states, with an emphasis on Vietnam. The key questions we will examine include the following: When and why do social movements occur? How are movements organized? What do movement participants think and feel? How do social movements work? How do authorities respond to movements? Why do movements decline? What changes do movements bring about? How do Vietnamese social movements emerge and grow? Any challenges ahead for Vietnamese civil society?\\nThe course will be divided into two main parts. The first devoted to theories of social movements and the ways in which our understanding of social movements has changed over time. We will also examine mobilization to social movements and ask why some people come to participate while others do not as well as the tactics  and successes of various social movements. The second is reserved for discussion of Vietnam\'s nascent social movements. There will be also experiential learning format in the course through which students will have the chance to visit an NGO in Ho Chi Minh City.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the end of this course, the student will be able to:\\nExplain the main theories and concepts used in class.\\nLearn the analytic tools necessary to examine and critically assess the role of social movements in our society.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned in class to better understand historical and modern social movement causes and campaigns.\\nDesign a research project that incorporates a clear hypothesis, literature review, and data analysis on the topic of social movements.\\nCritically analyze and evaluate published research.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned to analyze emerging civil society and social movements in Vietnam\\nDevelop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.\\n---\\nSyllabus\\nCourse Readings: There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Canvas and consist of book chapters and journal articles that either discuss key theoretical paradigms used in the study of social movements and/or apply them to specific social movements.\\n\\nWeek 1: Introduction: Conceptualizing Social Movements\\nTilly, Charles.

Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Web-based talks and conversations with representative scholars in Vietnamese Studies from North America, Europe, East- and Southeast Asia will help students recognize the global aspects of this fascinating academic field. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. At the end of the course, students are encouraged to work in team on a research topic of their choice with transdisciplinary approaches. This course is open to VSM majors and non-majors.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: After finishing this course, students should be able to \\n- Recognize the importance of Vietnam Studies from a variety of perspectives;\\n- Obtain a general view of Vietnam Studies as it is practiced widely and differently in Vietnam as well in the rest of the world, thus get ready for their graduate studies;\\n- Get connected with leading scholars/experts from Vietnam and overseas;\\n- How to contextualize Vietnam in regional/area studies;\\n- How to identify a substantial and meaningful Vietnam-based research topic that can trigger international interests;\\n- Locate various (re)sources for their understanding of and research on Vietnam; \\n- Apply transdisciplinary approaches to their research.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nAttendance & participation (10%)\\nBi-weekly responses (30%)\\n(re)sources survey (20%)\\nFinal team project (40%)","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}]},{"title":"Digital Creative Writing: Lessons from Vietnamese and Non-Vietnamese Writers","id":"VS207_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"\u0110\xe0o L\xea Na","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NxQAJ/vs207fall2021s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Dao Le Na - E: na.dao@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory- Arts & Humanities (C1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: Currently, creative writing is widely applied in many fields. Additionally, creative writing is also an essential subject for those who want to become professional writers as well as share their works through digital platforms. This course accumulates several skills, including reading and analyzing literary works, observations, research, along with in-depth interviews. The core of the course is to help students discover the digital world and how to compose digital texts. Students will be encouraged to think out of the box, explore their favorite creative writing styles, and choose a suitable form for their works and other ones of interactive storytelling in new media. Furthermore, contemporary social issues, historical and cultural issues of Vietnam in the context of globalization are going to be taken as the main themes of students\u2019 works. The course will be joined by both national and international experts, famous writers, such as: Ocean Vuong, Nguyen Thanh Viet, Monique Truong, Suzanne Joinson, Tran Thuy Mai and so on to share their experiences through online platform. Students will combine theoretical knowledge, including reading, analysing literary works, with practical observation gained from a field trip to find their creative materials.

Originated from Buddhism but now practiced out of their Buddhist philosophical/ontological contexts, they seem to establish certain living styles habitually described as \u201cpositive,\u201d or \u201cconscious,\u201d but at the same time, are running the risk of going against what the Buddha taught. Thus, to better understand those concepts and put them back into practice more effectively, one cannot but return to their root which is Buddhism. Buddhist ethics (\u201cethics\u201d here can be simply defined as a system of moral principles) undoubtedly plays a crucial role in Vietnamese moral life.\\nIn Vietnam as well as elsewhere, one of the causes that create generation gaps between parents and children is the fact that they are living with/practicing not the same ethical values. A common ethical ground must be first founded to bridge the gaps, to ensure mutual understanding between the individual and her/his ever-expanded communal networks, starting with the family (as the core of society), to community (such as hamlet or village), nation, and finally to the world (natural world included). With the whole-person education framework, the Fulbright University Viet Nam aims to develop its graduates not only as young promising professionals in their fields, but also as moral citizens who can significantly contribute to society in contemporary Vietnamese and global contexts. Such a goal surely cannot be achieved in the absence of moral principles (or ethics).\\nThrough reading assignments, guest lectures given by Vietnamese and international scholars as well as religious practitioners, and field study trips, students of this course will be exposed to various Buddhist traditions performed in Vietnam, East- and Southeast Asian regions. Films, literature, and newspapers will serve as the main sources for case studies and reference. Service learning is also required as an integral part of the course.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nAfter finishing the course, students should be able to:\\n* Acquire a general understanding of Buddhism and its key concepts, moral values, practices, and movements in various regional settings of East- and Southeast Asia, with a focus on Vietnam.\\n* Identify similarities and differences between Western concepts of \u201cethics\u201d and particular aspects of Buddhist ethics.\\n* Recognize Buddhist ethical values practiced in Vietnam and neighboring countries, and refer to Buddhist moral principles as a reference in their daily life.\\n* Explain the rise, popularity, and importance of certain social practices deeply rooted in Buddhism (such as \u201cMindfulness\u201d or \u201cLoving kindness\u201d) around the world, particularly in contemporary Vietnam.\\n* Appreciate Buddhist ethics as an effective way for self-cultivation to become a whole person, a good citizen, and a responsible professional.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nAttendance & participation (10%)\\nBi-weekly responses (30%)\\nService-learning (20%) \u2013 to be discussed with students\\nFinal team project (40%)","categories":["Core","E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}]}]')},142:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('[{"title":"Introduction to Photography History and Theory","id":"ARTS103_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Tran Vi Chau","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OPQAZ/arts103spring2022s01","description":"Faculty: Tran Vi Chau \u2013 E: chau.tran@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: ARTS101 Introduction to Visual Studies\\nFormat: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: We live today in a world of photographic images. Photography is present in a wide range of practices from avant-garde arts to mass media, from the convention of photo identification to the techniques of surveillance, from photojournalism to selfies and Instagram. Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded. With special attention to the intersection of photography and Vietnamese history, the course will also demonstrate how constellations of power - with regards to class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economy, and geopolitics - influence the practice, dissemination, and preservation of photography in Vietnam today.\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe course is designed to encourage students to: \\n\u2022 Acquire a solid foundation on key theoreticians and artists who have engaged with the medium of photography. \\n\u2022 Adopt an integrated range of flexible, research-led approaches to the studies of photographic history and theories. \\n\u2022 Strengthen key skills in writing, reading, and public engagement necessary for higher-level courses in the Art and Media Studies major as well as related fields.","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"}],"location":"Classroom 6 & 7"},{"title":"Dance and Performance Production","id":"ARTS106_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Alexander Tu Nguyen","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NzQAJ/arts106spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Alexander Tu Nguyen - E: alexander.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite or Co-requisite: No\\nFormat: On-Campus\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course will introduce students to both the theoretical and practical fundamentals of dance, and the ways in which dance performances are produced.

We will look at how narratives fuel various political agendas as well as the many strategies artists and filmmakers use to counter dominant narratives. We will deepen our understanding of these concepts, techniques, and problematics through in-class viewings and discussion of various moving image works, supported by theoretical readings focusing on the role of narrative in literature, film, and art.

A successful investment and fund management strategy, however, takes much more than what we see on Shark Tank. It requires crafting an investment thesis, gaining access to the best deal-flow, conducting due diligence, structuring transactions, and managing portfolio investments right up until exit. Along the way, investors need to navigate the often sensitive and complex interpersonal dynamics between themselves and their entrepreneurs, co-investors, and Limited Partners (LPs), just to name a few.\\n\\nAt the same time, ESG and impact investing is gaining momentum, with some of the world\'s leading fund managers incorporating social, environmental and governance factors into their investment decisions. What does it mean to pursue social and environmental outcomes when investing? Is there a trade-off between social impact and financial returns? We will begin to unpack some of these issues as well.\\n\\nThis course is aimed at students seeking to understand the \'nuts and bolts\' of early-stage investing and impact investing. It will be taught in a highly experiential manner by a current practitioner of early-stage investing in Vietnam. Students will learn the basic terminology, processes and strategies of early-stage investing and will apply them to practical case examples. Students will also hear from a number of guest speakers, including leading investors, entrepreneurs and other experts in the ecosystem, to gain a varied perspective.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the end of this course, students should be able to: \\nUnderstand the basic terminology, actors, processes and strategies of the venture capital industry across its different stages, from investment thesis formulation to due diligence to exit\\nApply this knowledge to real examples, considering the situation from both the investors\' as well as the entrepreneurs\' point of view\\nArticulate investment recommendations through clear and concise investment memorandums\\nExplain the rise of impact investing and ESG investing and its potential implications for the investment industry more broadly\\n---\\nDetailed Sessions Guide\\nSession 1: The entrepreneurial journey \\nRequired Readings:\\n\u201cThe Entrepreneurial Journey\u201d, Stuart Crainer, London Business School  \\n\u201cThe Questions Every Entrepreneur Must Answer\u201d, Amar Bidhe, Harvard Business Review, 1996 \\nSession 2: Structure of the VC industry: Who\u2019s who and how do VCs make money? \\nRequired Readings:\\n\u201cA Day in the Life of a Venture Capitalist\u201d (Stanford Case E-44, January 28, 2013) \\n\u201c16 Definitions on the Economics of VC\u201d, Scott Kupor, Andreessen Horowitz \\n\u201cSix Myths About Venture Capitalists\u201d, Diane Mulcahy, HBS \\nChapter 1 \u201cThe Players\u201d and Chapter 10 \u201cHow Venture Capital Funds Work\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson \\nSession 3: Developing a fund investment thesis \\nRequired Readings:\\nChapter 6 \u201cDefining Your Fund\u2019s Investment Strategy\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani \\nDoes your VC have an investment thesis or a hypothesis?, David Teten and Stephane Nasser, TechCrunch120 \\nCompilation of VC Investment Theses, Alexander Jarvis \\nA Short Guide to Impact Investing, The Case Foundation \\nSession 4: Deal sourcing and initial selection \\nRequired Readings:\\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned About Deal Sourcing, Danielle Morrill \\nHow VCs Source Deals, Allen Latta  \\nIn Defence of the Deck, Bill Gurley  \\nChapter 15 \u201cSourcing Investment Opportunities\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \\nSession 5: Due diligence \\nRequired Readings:\\nChapter 16 \u201cThe Art of Conducting Due Diligence\u201d and Chapter 17 \u201cManagement Team Diligence\u201d and Chapter 18 \u201cDiligence beyond Management\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \\nImpact Due Diligence: Emerging Best Practices, Pacific Community Ventures \\nSession 6: Cap tables and Valuation \\nRequired Readings:\\n\u201cFinancing New Ventures\u201d (HBS Note N9-811-093, March 28, 2011)  \\n\u201cNote on Valuation in Private Company Settings (HBS #9-297-050, April 2002)  \\nChapter 7 \u201cThe Capitalization Table\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \\nSession 7: Term Sheets and Legal  \\nRequired Readings:\\nChapters 3 - 6, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \\nVenture Capital Lexicon, Series A Term Sheet, Singapore Venture Capital ASsociation (SVCA)  \\n\u201cVenture Capital Negotiations: VC versus the Entrepreneur\u201d (HBS # 9-800-170, March 2, 2000) \\nSession 8: What happens after the deal is closed: portfolio management through to exit \\nRequired Readings:\\nHow to Build a Great Startup Board: Part I and II, Reid Hoffman  \\n\u201cThe Secret to Making Board Meetings Suck Less\u201d  \\nMeasuring and Managing Impact: A Practical Guide, EVPA  \\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nClass contribution and attendance (20%) - based on general participation and in class contributions  \\nReflections on in-class dialogues/simulations (30%) \u2013 as mentioned this course will include \u2018dialogues\u2019 and \'simulations\' of parts of the investment process.

The approach propels students to look beyond the class content on the internet for project ideas, which give students ever-increasing exposure to the latest technologies around the world especially the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in product development. Through our own experiences with several PBL-based engineering courses (i.e., Design & Systems Thinking; Sensor, Measurement and Analysis; Integrated Engineering Project) and student-led engineering projects (i.e., E-Dap; Hearty Plant) at Fulbright University Vietnam, we notice that many students\u2019 projects are based on IoT technology. Furthermore, we also notice that in most projects, students have a lot of difficulty in finding a good communication solution for data pipeline between hardware products (e.g., sensors, actuators, controllers, processing units) and software controls (e.g., data acquisition and analysis, transmission of control commands) as illustrated in the following figure. The deficiency in the solution boils down to students\u2019 inadequate exposure to communication protocols and editions of database management system that are customizable and interactable with various control systems and web application servers. \\nIn general, undergraduate students could not develop such a communication solution for their IoT products from the ground up because of course duration, dependency on open-source platforms and insufficient knowledge in IoT technologies. On the contrary, the budget for a normal undergraduate engineering project is not enough to purchase expensive IoT solutions currently available on the market. \\nThese motivate us to propose this independent research project under the advisory of Dr. Truong Trung Kien, one of our Engineering lecturers. The project will focus on researching and developing a consistent, low-cost, student-feasible communication solution, enabling students to remotely control their products, automatically retrieve real-time statistical reports of the system and potentially develop self-monitoring algorithms later. We believe that the learning and experience in this research project will greatly assist us, as well as our engineering peers at Fulbright University Vietnam, to be more confident in developing IoT-based products in future engineering projects. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nIt is expected that after completing this independent research project, the students will be able to: \\n[Strong background] Acquire knowledge in the field of IoT and automation in engineering system with the appropriate breadth and depth in order to solve systematically corresponding engineering problems or to invent, design and build IoT-based engineering products. \\n[Proactive consideration] Design an engineering solution that meet specific needs of FUV engineering students with appropriate consideration of student development, educational environment, market requirements, and economic factors. \\n[Analytical thinking] Identify, analyze, and decompose compose complex engineering problems along with available resources, authentic constraints using principles of computer science and engineering sciences.\\n[Effective communication] Listen actively and present clearly to people with different backgrounds to deliver the proposed engineering solution through oral, written, and visual media. \\n[Productive collaboration] Work effectively and responsibly as an individual and as a member in the research group in an independent research project. \\n[Hands-on experience] Design, configure, test and evaluate the performance of an engineering system that integrates communication protocols of hardware and software of different engineering functionality, automated data acquisition and processing, and remote transmission of control commands\\n---\\nTentative Schedule and Workplan:\\n---\\nProposed artifacts for assessment:\\n1. A report of our research, design, implementation, and learning. \\n2. An architectural diagram of the proposed communication solution. \\n3. A workshop to present our proposed communication solution for engineering-interested students\\nGroup work:\\nTwo members in the current research project will work closely together and be both responsible for the following works: \\n\u2022 Desk research about the chosen topic \\n\u2022 Report of works and findings of the assigned research parts \\n\u2022 Updates of the project progress with faculty supervisor \\n\u2022 Completion of proposed artifacts \\nEach member will be mainly in charge of leading the following parts: \\nPham Hoang Lan:\\nResearch of suitable technological platforms for the aiming solution \\nConnections and communications between hardware and software protocols \\nSummary report of the research project \\nPhan Ngoc Lan Khanh:\\nResearch of suitable database management system for the aiming solution \\nAutomated data processing and transmission of control commands to the system \\nFeatures of sample interface presenting the transition of data and control signal from hardware to software and vice versa \\nThe students will be assessed based on their performance on the individually assigned tasks.

It has swung wildly from the liberal internationalism of the Obama administration to the America First nationalism of the Trump administration back to the more cooperative globalism of the Biden administration. How are we to make sense of this? What can Vietnamese leaders do to manage their relations with the US? This interdisciplinary online course examines the US position in the world in a contemporary and historical context to answer these questions. Over the duration of this course, we will examine how the United States has engaged with other peoples, nations and global forces; how other peoples and nations have seen the United States in the world; and how global forces have shaped the United States. By the end of the term, you will be able to explain American global behaviour and suggest ways in which other countries like Vietnam should engage with the United States in the global arena. This course will be divided into three units that build off one another to develop your understanding of the US in the World. In the first unit, we will examine the Cold War and how it shaped the American perception of its global role in the twentieth century. In the second unit, we will go back to the end of the nineteenth century to examine how the United States engaged with the people of the Global South, proceeding through the mid-point of the twentieth century when the global forces of decolonization intersected with the Cold War to push the United States into foreign entanglements, like Vietnam\u2019s war for independence and unification. In the third unit we will consider how the combined experiences of the Cold War and responding to decolonization set the stage for contemporary American global politics and what this means for the relations other nations have with the United States government in the twenty-first century.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\\n1. Identify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\\n2. Explain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\\n3. Explain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\\n4. Explain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\\n5.

Who gets to make Vietnamese foreign policy, and what are they doing to assert Vietnamese sovereignty in the South China Sea (East Sea), dealing with climate change, and securing Covid vaccines? Developed in dialogue with the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam and active and retired Vietnamese diplomats, History of Vietnamese Diplomacy invites the students to walk in the footsteps of the lucky few who have shaped Vietnam\u2019s place in the world from 1945 to the present day, through collection and examination of rare and valuable historical documents and oral histories for classwork and independent research.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\nStudents will be introduced to research methodologies in the field of diplomatic history\\nStudents will gain knowledge in Vietnamese diplomatic history\\nStudents will be introduced to key online and off-line resources for the study of Vietnamese diplomatic history\\nStudents will independently learn to conduct literature reviews and write annotated bibliographies\\nStudents will come up with a proposal for a research project in Vietnamese diplomatic history\\nStudents will learn to peer-review each other\'s works and research collaboratively\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nScaffolded assignments including: reading responses, a literature review, an annotated bibliography, a research proposal, and a short research paper.","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"}],"location":"Classroom 6 & 7"},{"title":"Research Seminar: America\u2019s Nuclear Age: The United States, Nuclear Weapons and","id":"HIS303_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Matthew Jones","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002HzUD6QAN/his303spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Matthew Jones - E: matthew.jones@fulbright.edu.vn \\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: Completion of Global History Lab and/or Fulbright History Lab\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCourse Format: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course looks at the way nuclear weapons and the challenges they have posed have influenced the course of American foreign and defence policy, strategic thinking, and domestic politics, from the instigation of the Manhattan project \u2013 the US program to develop an atomic bomb \u2013 to the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s and a little beyond. Consideration will also be given to the influence of the \u2018nuclear age\u2019 on US cultural and social trends. The course will examine the political and moral dilemmas raised by the possession and possible use of nuclear weapons, the role they have played in the way the United States pursued its policies during the years of Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union and People\u2019s Republic of China, and the domestic political controversies that US nuclear policies engendered. In the latter area we will consider the rise of anti-nuclear grass roots activism in the United States, alongside the place of nuclear issues in presidential elections and Congressional politics. We will also necessarily study some of the major events and crises of the Cold War, including the Berlin crises of 1948, 1958/9 and 1961, the course of the Korean War, and the Cuban missile crisis. The last portion of the course features analysis of the international negotiations over arms control and non-proliferation that have featured since the late 1960s and the controversies they generated. Throughout the course students will engage with contemporary writings and study primary source documents which will accompany each topic.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Students on the course will have as their objectives:\\n1.

People are interested in nature, the aesthetic, and the technological application of light. Light provides us with an omnipotent tool to perceive almost everything from the world of sub-atomic particles to the Cosmos, but a sustainable and effective solution for various sectors of modern life, including, but not limited to, food, communication, entertainment, energy, environment, and medicine. Microwave for food heating, fiber-optic telecommunication for the Internet, laser for the massive digital data storage and reading, light detection and ranging for the autonomous vehicle, x-ray for medical imaging, fluorescence for food quality assessment, etc., are among countless examples of the light-based technologies. Those have been integrated seamlessly into our daily life, but we rarely appreciate how they work. The course aims to provide a solid background of the fundamental characteristics of light, its interaction with the matter, the mechanism of the light production, light transportation, and light detection. We will discuss technological applications of those aspects in light of the well-established and emerging technologies. We hope by the end, students will treasure the beauty of light and explore it as a sustainable solution for our common home, the Earth. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\n\u2022 Some includes, but not limited to,  \\n\u2022 Understand the nature of light\\n\u2022 Understand how light is produced, how they interact with matter, how we can manipulate them \\n\u2022 Recognize the technical application of the light in the daily assets such as microwave, camera, x-ray\u2026\\n\u2022 Practical skills to handle the light source and light sensor\\n\u2022 Computing and data anlysis skills\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nTentative syllabus: for 6 hours/week in 8 weeks.

What is the future then?\\nIn this course, we will learn about important materials, their history, production, and properties. What makes paper, cloth, and plastic so different even though they are all organic polymers? What is the magic key step in both steel and semiconductor production? What properties make copper a great material for electronics and statues? Each material has its story full of ups and downs that involves not only science but also culture and economics. Their distinctive properties influence their usage in manufacturing and arts. How might these stories connect to you? What would be a perfect material in your opinion? We will explore questions like these, do some experiments, and have you look at the materials that make up your own living environment. We will also talk about pigments, which is a bit nontraditional for a material course, but I love them.

Instrumental analysis is crucial in conducting scientific research, evaluating the quality of materials including food and drinks, assessing environmental pollution and assisting forensic investigation, to name a few. In this courses, students will learn the science and conduct small projects using common instrumental techniques. They include Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Inverted Microscope (IM), Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and potentially others. FTIR is used to analyze chemical compositions and chemical bonds of a sample. IM with camera magnifies physical, chemical and biological processes happening in micrometer scale to observe and capture. RT-PCR monitors the amplification reaction of a targeted DNA molecule which can be used in numerous applications, such as quantifying microbial and vial load in a sample for the diagnostic of infectious diseases. ICP-OES is used to qualify and quantify chemical elements of a sample, especially metals. FTIR, IM and RT-PCR are available at Fulbright\'s lab. ICP-OES and other techniques are available at our collaborated labs and company.\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, students will:\\n\u2022 Demonstrate understanding of fundamental knowledge behind five instrumental analysis techniques: FTIR, Inverted Microscope, RT-PCR, ICP-OES and potentially others\\n\u2022 Demonstrate practical skills about using the above instruments\\n\u2022 Utilize software to visualize, analyze and calculate physical and chemical properties of molecules and materials using the above techniques\\n\u2022 Analyze data and present experimental data\\n\u2022 Writing scientific lab reports\\n---\\nCourse Schedule\\nTextbooks:\\nFundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering: An Integrated Approach, 5th Editionby William D.

We will read in order to understand texts as cultural artifacts specific to the time and place of their composition, and in order to investigate the sociopolitical implications of literary texts, both for their time and ours. We will read to foster critical thinking skills and to become better examiners of texts. We will read for aesthetic appreciation. We will read for the sheer thrill of it.

K. Rowling, Ralph Ellison, Italo Calvino, and Viet Thanh Nguyen. Our texts will be Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone, Invisible Man, Invisible Cities, and The Sympathizer. We will examine theories of identity and otherness, and discover the origin of the Invisibility Cloak. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: \\nWe will read the entirety of Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s The Committed, his 2021 sequel to the Pulitzer Prize winning book The Sympathizer. (It is not necessary to have read the first book, since the plot is helpfully recapitulated in the opening section.) The Committed is a searing indictment of colonialism, and presents a nameless narrator who is split into three separate selves. We will also read the beginning third of Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man, the 1952 masterpiece on which The Committed is very loosely based. Like Nguyen, Ellison introduces a nameless narrator whose internal conflicts threaten to tear him apart. We will read most of J. K. Rowling\u2019s brilliant treatment of the subject of otherness and belonging, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone (originally published in 1997 as Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone), which painfully exposes the divide between wizards and humans. Additional texts introducing other theoretical angles on the question of invisibility will be brought in as necessary. Students will be evaluated on four things: 1) class participation throughout the course, 2) a short presentation, 3) five written responses keyed to the readings, and 4) two written papers, the first analyzing a small shared aspect of the texts, and the second providing an opportunity for a broader perspective on what is a wide-ranging subject of inexhaustible interest to human beings.\\n---\\nCourse Schedule\\nTexts:\\nJ.

Young people have been the backbone of post-colonial struggles, nation-building process, and various social and cultural movements across the region. Although there has been a growing interest in youth\u2019s relationship with broader social issues, Asian youth has received little attention in the classroom. This course aims to offer students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of youth and society in Asia and to explore youth\u2019s significance in the region\u2019s past, present, and future. It begins from examining various theoretical traditions that conceptualize and treat youth in different manners. It then examines critical historical periods in which youth played a critical part in instigating or otherwise shaping major processes of political and social change in Asia. Finally, the course investigates and compares various relationships that Asian youth have developed with the state, citizenship and culture from a perspective that sheds light on the interplay of individual developments and broader sociocultural contexts. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning youth in Vietnam and Asia.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\n\u2022 Comprehend social and cultural developments in relation to youth\u2019s place and role in Vietnam and Asia;\\n\u2022 Use basic concepts and theories of youth from social and cultural sciences;\\n\u2022 Read critically the literature and other materials;\\n\u2022 Write and present academic research reports; and\\n\u2022 Reflect upon youth\u2019s relationships with the state and society in Vietnam and Asia.\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nWeek 1: Introduction - Film discussion\\nWeek 2: Youth: concepts and theories\\nWeek 3: Youth in Asia\u2019s modern history\\nWeek 4: Youth in contemporary Asia: Northeast Asia\\nWeek 5: Youth in contemporary Asia: Southeast Asia\\nWeek 6: Youth and the state - Youth as citizens\\nWeek 7: Midterm quiz/exam - Film discussion\\nWeek 8: Youth and economic development - Youth and work\\nWeek 9: Youth and political participation - Youth and political representation\\nWeek 10: Youth and identity - Youth and gender\\nWeek 11: Research project presentations and peer-reviews\\nWeek 12: Youth and culture - Field research (Group)\\nWeek 13: Youth and digital world - Field research (Individual)\\nWeek 14: Research findings presentations and peer-reviews\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nClass participation -- 20%\\nMidterm quiz/exam -- 20%\\nResearch Project Presentation -- 10%\\nResearch findings presentations -- 20% \\nFinal essay -- 30%","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"}],"location":"Action"},{"title":"Augustus in Saigon?

Particularly, the colonial past has been written into the urban space (in form of architectures, monuments, inscriptions, etc.) in a penetrating way. With it, Greek and Roman antiquities have entered and framed the peoples\u2018 and viewers\u2018 mind, too, either directly or indirectly. \\nThe aim of the course is to open these framed and framing spaces for a critical dialogue about the use, and abuse, of classical themes in the past and the way we can deal with this heritage in the present, and future. This dialogue will be triggered and established by linking classicized spaces in present-day Ho Chi Minh City with original artifacts of Graeco-Roman antiquity in a digital, interactive way. \\nBuilding on the concept of smart city, we will activate the students to critically deal with, and reflect on, the classical heritage by creating a digital exhibition via OMEKA that links the physically present structures with digital objects in a communicative, interactive way. This digital exhibition also enables the broader public to engage with their own past and to give them a handy tool at hand to live their urban space anew in the 21st century.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\n\u2022 introduction to theories and methodologies in history/art history/architecture (e.g., critical source analysis; discourse theory; structuralist- and post-structuralist approaches; frame and framing theories; image theory; social space theory; affordances; actor-object-networks; object-biography) [scientific competences]\\n\u2022 introduction to digital tool OMEKA (basic html-programming skills; cross-linking; design of digital maps, timelines, audio-video-files etc.) [digital humanities comp.]\\n\u2022 analysis of selected urban spaces and Graeco-Roman artifacts with respective research literature [scientific comp.]\\n\u2022 interpretation of innate narratives of the selected sources in critical manner [transfer and critical engagement comp.]\\n\u2022 creation of digital exhibition (by application of skills aquired from steps before) [digital humanities comp.]\\n\u2022 organisation and management of complex group-work (assignment of tasks and responsibilities; feedback culture; presentation skills etc.) [social and organizational comp.]\\n\u2022 audience-oriented presentation and marketing of digital exhibition (writing of appealing texts; balanced text-image-relation; logo / corporate identity design; etc.) [organizational and transfer comp., media comp.]\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nTopic/Content: Introduction to the topic \\nForm: Team-building activity / first orientation & examples\\nTopic/Content: Introduction to Historical Source Criticism\\nForm: Reflection on historical analysis and interpretation I\\nReading: J.

At the end of the nineteenth century, the \u201cnew woman\u201d pushed against the limits imposed by society. Following the footsteps of their counterparts in Europe and North America, the East Asian \u201cnew woman\u201d emerged during the interwar period seeking autonomy, redefining the feminine, exploring new ideas, lifestyles and behavior, and negotiating between the \u201ctraditional\u201d and the \u201cmodern\u201d. More than a century has passed but women of the 21stcentury still find themselves facing the challenges of negotiating between dominant gender roles and desires for self-liberation and self-determination. The course focuses on the dilemmas that women had to and still have to deal with in their pursuit of liberation and in their fight against suppression. In doing so, it specifically considers various structural, cultural, and technological factors that have shaped and transformed new womanhood of the early modern period and the 21stcentury. Throughout the semester, students will consider how social structures and cultural practices have affected women and also how women themselves have struggled for equal status and rights. Among others, the course explores various ways, resources, and outcomes of women\u2019s constant negotiations between the dominant gender ideologies and desires for self-liberation and self-determination. Students will examine a variety of texts with the aim of investigating the continuity and change in narrations on new womanhood in general and in Asia in particular.\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\nComprehend the historical context in which the \u201cnew woman\u201d emerge during the early modern period;\\nRelate women\u2019s variegated experiences of emerging as the \u201cnew woman\u201d in the public sphere to specific national, regional and global contexts;\\nUnderstand women\u2019s dilemmas in their pursuit of liberation and in their fight against suppression in the early modern and 21st-century context;\\nDevelop analytical skills in examining women\u2019s constant negotiations between the dominant gender ideologies and desires for self-liberation and self-determination; and,\\nWrite and present academic research reports.\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nWeek 1: Introduction\\nFilm discussion: \u201cTokyo Story\u201d by Ozu Yasujiro (1953)or \u201cSweet Dream\u201d by Ju-nam Yang (1936)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmd_OBPFll8\\nWeek 2: Women, education, and modern technology\\nWeek 3: Women, consumption, and agency\\nWeek 4: Women and modernity in early modern period\\nWeek 5: \u201cNew women\u201d vs. \u201cmodern girls\u201d\\nWeek 6: Colonialism, nationalism, and the \u201cwise mother, good wife\u201d ideology\\nWeek 7: Midterm exam\\nFilm discussion: \u201cYeongja\u2019s Heyday\u201d by Ho Sun Kim (1975) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlPoTeWINSg\\nWeek 8: Women, development, and the state\\nWeek 9: Women, work, and power\\nWeek 10: Women, feminism, and the \u201c#MeToo\u201d movement\\nWeek 11: \u201cTiger mother\u201d vs. \u201cparasite single\u201d(parasaito shinguru) and\u201cKimchi woman\u201d (kimchinyeo)\\nWeek 12: Panel discussion 1: \u201cnew women\u201d vs. \u201cmodern girls\u201d\\nPanel discussion2: love, marriage, and new womanhood\\nWeek 13: Panel discussion3: women and the state\\nPanel discussion 4: women, feminism, and nationalism\\nWeek 14: Group project presentations\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nClass participation (20%)\\nMidterm exam (20%)\\nGroup Project (30%)\\nFinal essay (30%)","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Action"},{"title":"Language, Culture and Thought","id":"SOCI305_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Ian Scott Kalman","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OhQAJ/soci305spring2022s01","description":"Faculty: Ian Scott Kalman \u2013 E: ian.kalman@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCourse Format: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: What is language - and could we even ask this question without it? Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Language is not just about communication, words such as \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  \\nLanguage is intimately tied to experience \u2013 the way we talk about an event has a bearing on how we understand that event \u2013 were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d, or an insult? As much as language is something that humans produce, language is also part of what makes us human.  \\nThis course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in the study of language, beginning with philosophical questions on the origins of human language, the creation of linguistics as a distinct field of research, and the terms by which scholars have considered the relationships between language and culture.  \\nCore concepts include linguistic relativity, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. Core themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.  \\nPlease note, this is not a linguistics course. We will not be learning new languages or emphasizing the technical components of syntax and use. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as many core texts will be in English and draw upon English\\nLearning Objectives: Students Will Be Able To (SWBAT): \\n\u2022 Understand the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology as it commonly appears in academic texts.\\n\u2022 Identify the role of language in their own culture and thought with increasing amounts of subtlety and depth.  \\n\u2022 Employ key concepts from sociolinguistics in oral discussions and both a written paper and exam.  \\n\u2022 Develop and execute a research project relating to language, culture, and thought in their own lives.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nClass Participation -- 20%\\nThird-Term Exam -- 20%\\nArticle Review -- 10%\\nFinal Project Presentation -- 20%\\nFinal Project Paper -- 30%","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Science Lab"},{"title":"Global Political Economy","id":"SOCI307_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Jonathan London","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OUQAZ/soci307spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Jonathan London - E: jonathan.london@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: Foundations of Political Economy and/or Principles of Economics\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCourse Format: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course introduces theoretical and methodological approaches to the analysis of the world economy from the vantage point of global political economy (GPE), a multi-disciplinary field of inquiry that is founded on the assumption that economic aspects of social life may not be understood independently of politics and the broader sets of social relations and world historical contexts within which economics processes unfold.

We will investigate the central themes, theories, concepts, and questions of the contemporary study of comparative politics and explore the main theoretical, empirical, and methodological approaches to the study of Vietnamese politics. Why do nation states vary so substantially in their political freedoms and economic performances? What are similarities and differences that Vietnam bears from a comparative perspective? This course will seek to answer these big questions by developing an understanding of key concepts, theories and political system and policies of Vietnam. The course intertwines two major parts with Part I forming the foundation of the course by introducing the history, concepts, theories, and methodologies of Comparative Politics and the other exploring the actors and processes involved in the detailed case study, Vietnam. The course has a strong discussion-centered structure. Students are expected to read the assigned materials timely and thoughtfully and be ready to discuss the content in class.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Students should be able:\\nTo demonstrate a basic understanding of the relationships between individuals, actors, and processes across different political systems both historical and contemporary.\\nTo facilitate and/or cultivate a sense of critical awareness of the world beyond their own.\\nTo develop a stronger understanding of fundamental differences between different regime types, the relationship between politics and economic outcomes, the role of identity in politics.\\nTo apply the analytical and methodological tools of comparative politics to political outcomes they want to understand and explain.\\nTo use these tools to further examine the political system and policies of Vietnam. \\n---\\nCourse Readings:\\nThere is no textbook for this course.

Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts. Nowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular.   \\nBased on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past. This course help Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives.\\nIn addition, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese helps to re-establish a cultural and historical connection with East Asia, not only with China and Taiwan, but also Japan and the Korean nations. It is worth noting that these days, the Japanese still use 2,136 common Kanji (or Chinese characters with Japanese pronunciations). Those words can all be found in Vietnamese literary Chinese introduced in this course. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems. Students are also guided to use the dictionaries in different ways to be able to look up the vocabulary themselves.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: There are 3 basic Learning Objectives of this course:\\nHelping students understand Vietnamese cultural heritage better through Vietnamese literary Chinese texts.\\nHelping students to learn Sino-Vietnamese pronunciations of Chinese characters along with standard modern Chinese dictions, and to use Sino-Vietnamese words more accurately and effectively in modern Vietnamese language.\\nHelping students have a broader view of the culture and history of East Asian Cultural Sphere / Kanji Cultural Sphere.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance: 15%\\nQuizzes: 20%\\nMid-term: 15%\\nFinal exam: 50%","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Meeting room 1"},{"title":"Documentary Films from Vietnam: History, Theory, and Practice","id":"VS108_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Dao Le Na","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OaQAJ/vs108spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Dao Le Na - E: na.dao@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: Not recommended for students who have not completed Core requirement.\\nCourse Format: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: Documentary film has always had a certain appeal to the audience because it manifests the filmmakers\u2019 observation and point of view on real life. \u2018Reality\u2019, as Patricia Aufderheide mentioned in his book Documentary Film: a Very Short Introduction \u201cis not what is out there but what we know, understand, and share with each other of what is out there (\u2026) Documentary is an important reality-shaping communication, because of its claims to truth. Documentaries are always grounded in real life, and make a claim to tell us something worth knowing about it.\u201d Therefore, social issues of national identity, collective memory, gender, the diaspora will be effectively communicated to the audience through the visual expression of documentary storytelling.\\nThis course is directed to students who like watching documentaries and hope to make documentaries. The teaching team including Vietnamese documentary researchers and filmmakers will help students to focus on analyzing selected documentaries and practical filmmaking training. Students of this course will learn how to write a screenplay including find an idea and develop their ideas by multiple methods such as observation, field- notes, oral history, and narrative structure. Documentary filmmaking techniques will be trained by filmmakers through camera using, sound recording, log writing, and film editing. One of the course\u2019s features is that its students will make a documentary film based on Vietnamese cultural and social materials exposed to them during the course. At the end of the course, students will submit a documentary film in which academic knowledge can be utilized and integrated.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: This course will aim to:\\n\u2022 The ability to evaluate a documentary film\\n\u2022 Understanding the values of national documentary film and the relation between cinema and national identities.\\n\u2022 Understanding how to explore and handle cultural and social materials in making a documentary film\\n\u2022 Finding suitable storytelling tools and aesthetic viewpoints for a filmmaker\u2019s discourse\\n\u2022 Finding a suitable style to produce their films.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to:\\n\u2022 Be able to analyze a documentary film and write critically about how the film presents its aesthetic form and communicates its meaning\\n\u2022 Understanding the history of documentary film and identifying conventions and elements of a documentary film\\n\u2022 Understanding current debates about documentary ethics and aesthetics.\\n\u2022 Prepare and submit their own documentary film in appropriate storytelling\\n---\\nCourse schedule\\nRequired Materials\\nBernard, Sheila Curran (2004) Documentary Storytelling for Video and Filmmakers.

This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism. We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution? And we ask how have our ideas about \u201cchange\u201d changed over time?\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\n\xb7      Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.\\n\xb7      Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.\\n\xb7      Students will be able to critique each other\u2019s perspectives in the context of group discussions.\\n\xb7      Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nStudents are fully responsible for any missed classes and work.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\\n ---\\nLearning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to\\nUnderstand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\\nDefine the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\\nDecompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\\nBuild a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\\nImprove communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading: \\nMaker Space Training: 20%\\nTheory: 40%\\nApplication: 40%","categories":["Core"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Maker Space"},{"title":"Programming for Data Science and Visualization","id":"CS103_Summer2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Huynh The Dang","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002QXPZ8QAP/cs103summer2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Huynh The Dang - E: dang.huynh@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Math and Computing (E4)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description\\nThe Programming for Data Science and Visualization course aims at providing students with a set of skills to analyze the nature of data across different domains.

The course will be focused on the connection between different levels of intervention for the green planning and design, including village/district and relative technologies involved, especially the low and middle-tech, chosen according to the local conditions, culture and economy, what it is called Multi-Scale Approach. The discussion will touch several scales of design, from the bioregional scale down to the building. A common mistake in the discussion concerning the sustainability is the fragmentation of the planning. A single green building can not reach any results if it is not conceived into a large scale perspective. For this reason, the theory proposed in the course is the sustainability in a large scenario but connected with the local scale. Bio-Region, sustainable transportation system, Eco-Village and Eco-District, and finally Eco-Building will be connected with an organic plan, generating a general strategy where macro- and micro-scales are coherent and connected.\\nAn important part of the research will be the issue of the sustainable transportation. This mostly concerns the different modality of transportation, their structure and inter-connection, TOD system and Smart Node.\\nThe theory concerning the sustainability, Eco-Village and Eco-District will be both technical and theoretical. This teaching is based on a series of books that Professor Paolo Vincenzo Genovese published in the past years. Professor Genovese will apply his experience as a professional designer in sustainable district and Eco-Village planned in the Chinese context.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nTo analyze the complexity of the sustainability at large scale;\\nTo consider the sustainability as a complex system made by various variables. The students will be instructed that every possible solution in the field of sustainability could emanate only from the combination of different majors, including social, architectural, technological and economical spheres;\\nTo investigate real cases, study trips, workshops, focus on real projects and research at national and international levels;\\nTo communicate with government institutions and private companies to investigate some key topics of sustainability at both building and urban planning levels;\\nTo investigate the topic of Multi-Scale Approach at social, economical and technological levels applied in the local context;\\nTo develop study cases, theory and technology for Appropriate Technology and Zero Emission Buildings;\\n---\\nAssessments:\\nFinal Exam\\nThe exam will be based on an individual paper for each student for the theoretical part. The students will prepare also a project developed according to their own interests and with the investigation on the local context. The project could be individual or collective. The topic of the papers and the project will be decided between students and professor after a preliminary discussion.","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"18:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"18:00:00"}],"location":"Online"},{"title":"Exploring Identities in Asia","id":"SOCI209_Summer2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Chang Yau Hoon","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002QXPY0QAP/soci209summer2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Chang-Yau Hoon - E: chang-yau.hoon@fulbright.edu.vn \\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: Online\\n--- \\nCourse Description  \\nThe objective of the course is to provide students with a multi-disciplinary perspective into the diversity of cultures and societies in Asia, and to critically evaluate the various meanings and representations of Asia and Asians.

In view of the urgent problems of our time, for example, climate change, it is entrepreneurs who inspire hope with technology-based developments and thus play a central role in politics and society. At the same time, entrepreneurs are ambivalent contemporaries who are seen as role models and are envied because of their success but are also often confronted with criticism and suspicion. All over the world, entrepreneurship is increasingly popular and is being promoted by governments, international organizations, and local NGOs as an income-generating strategy or as a solution to so-called \\"disaster capitalism\\".\\nIn this course, we approach the anthropology of entrepreneurship from different theoretical perspectives. Starting in the middle of the 20th century, where on the one hand the relationship between entrepreneurship and social change (or the entrepreneur as a change agent) and the role of entrepreneurship in economic development were in focus, we follow how the perception and the view of anthropologists changed over time. Ethnographic examples range from Melanesian big men who became entrepreneurs, to ethnic, religious, ecological, and social entrepreneurship and to research on individual self-realization through entrepreneurship.\\n---\\nCourse Objectives \\nLearning objectives event\\nGetting to know theoretical debates and empirical case studies on entrepreneurship\\nIndependent literature research\\nStudents learn to critically question concepts relevant to the course\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes \\nAfter completing this course, students will be able to: \\nAcquire an understanding of the historical, political, and cultural context, current trends and future projections of digital technologies; \\nExplain basic concepts and theories in new (digital) media; \\nUnderstand the critical impact of media on a variety of contemporary issues such as privacy, surveillance, labor, and participation, as well as the construction of individual identity \u2013 gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality. \\nBe able to critically examine and utilize digital tools in meaningful and innovative ways. \\n---\\nAssessments\\nClass Participation\\nPresentation\\nSeminar Paper\\nLife Story Interviews (transcribed)","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"12:00:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"12:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 4 & 5"},{"title":"Evolution of Vietnamese Society in the 20th century from a multidisciplinary per","id":"VS301_Summer2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Hoang Thach Quan","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002QXPXgQAP/vs301summer2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Hoang Thach Quan \u2013 E: quan.hoang@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCross-listed: Vietnam Studies, Social Studies\\nFormat: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\n\u201cConnections are the source of life in Vietnam\u2026 [They] are constitutive of [the Vietnamese] self, community, and nation,\u201d observes a Vietnam scholar. This course examines those vital connections and the social structures that create, shape and sustain them. In doing so, we will examine how those structures have been transformed and changed throughout the twentieth century up to the present moment. In this interdisciplinary course, we will draw on a variety of historical, sociological and anthropological works to help shed light on the ways \u201csocial capital,\u201d to use a modern concept, is built (or destroyed) and human connections preserved (or severed) for countless generations of Vietnamese, past and present.  \\nAlthough the focus of the course is contemporary Vietnamese society and culture, any exploration of the present would be woefully incomplete without it being firmly anchored in the past, which for our course revolves around the traditional village and community that has been the life blood of Vietnam for the past thousands of years. We will therefore begin our course by looking at the traditional Vietnamese village structures and the social norms that govern the life choices and behavior of its residents. From there we embark on a historical journey that takes us through the colonial, revolutionary, and post-revolutionary periods until we reach the present time. \\nThroughout the course students are encouraged to think about the structural forces that deeply influence, or in most cases, dictate one\u2019s thoughts and behaviors, and the role and place of an individual in the larger social structure in which he/she is embedded. Questions that students taking this course may want to think about include, but are not limited to, the following: What are the sources of Vietnamese culture and identity? How important are human connections and how can they be preserved? Is one\u2019s identity permanent and fixed, or is it contingent, fluid and negotiable? Would a Vietnamese person today still recognize and understand a Vietnamese born hundreds of years ago? Is it possible to essentialize some quality (or set of qualities) that captures all that is Vietnamese?  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe course aims to give students a better understanding of Vietnamese society and culture and the trajectory of her evolution for the last one hundred years or so from a multidisciplinary perspective.  \\nStudents will be introduced to basic concepts in the humanities, sociology and anthropology. This will provide them with a wider and sharper lens through which to view themselves, their society, and hopefully also the wider world into which Vietnam is trying integrate\\nStudents will be able to interpret and analyze the causes and consequences of many common social, cultural phenomenon in modern-day Vietnam. On that basis, it is hoped that they will accordingly formulate an appropriate philosophical outlook and chart an effective and wise career path for personal development and social betterment after graduation.\\n---\\nCourse Schedule\\nSESSION 1 Introducing Key Concepts and Theoretical Framework to Understand the Trajectory of Vietnamese Society\u2019s Evolution \\nReading \\nT\xf6nnies, Ferdinand. \u201cCommunity and Society [Gemeinschaft Und Gesellschaft]\u201d in Jan Lin & Christopher Mele, eds.

After the past few years upheaval and distress, this suggestion may no longer seem very far-fetched. Concerns about social, ecological, and technological crises, when thematized, however, are often relegated to genres of fiction suggesting a certain departure from reality. If our circumstances have become similar to a \u201cwork of science fiction,\u201d then we must also take a closer look at how works of not just science fiction, but also horror and fantasy, rely on the boundaries between familiar and unfamiliar\u2014enabling us to imagine and cognitively process difficult questions that at first, seem uncanny and estranged from our lives.\\nIn this course, we will examine film and media primarily from East Asia that are concerned with the gap between the familiar and the unfamiliar. Through different genres of media, we examine how bodies, spaces, and even the Earth itself\u2014that we take for granted as familiar entities\u2014can become uncanny, strange, and alien. Our class discussion will take us from questions of environmental crisis and neo-imperialism in Bong Joon Ho\u2019s spin on the monster film genre in The Host, through the politics of the self and the boundaries between human and machine in Mamoru Oshii\u2019s Ghost in the Shell, and Huang Jianxin\u2019s Dislocation, to concerns about the end of the Anthropocene and human dominance over Earth in Chi Hui\u2019s The Rainforest and Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Nausicaa, Valley of the Wind. This course will introduce students to a wide range of East Asian language film and media materials in translation. No previous knowledge of the region is required.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nAnalyze films and texts, annotate with proficiency in filmic (visual, audio) and other formal techniques \\nWrite, construct, and present analyses into a clear, original, and persuasive interpretive claims, in both oral and written formats \\nConduct and present research in the art and media humanities \\nCreate original arguments that address the larger questions of the course \\nRevise and incorporate feedback and comments into projects and assignments from peers and instructors.\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n(topics to be reduced) \\n\\nWeek 1 \u2013 Introductions and the Uncanny \\nSigmund Freud, \u201cThe \u2018Uncanny\u2019\u201d (1919), 219-226, 238-252 \\nDuke University Writing Studio, \u201cWriting about Film\u201d \\n\\nWeek 2 \u2013 Heterotopias and the Monster \\nBong Joon Ho, The Host \\nTimothy Corrigan, Writing About Film. \u201cPreparing to watch and preparing to write\u201d and \u201cApproaches to Writing about Film\u201d \\nHye Jean Chung - Chapter 4: Heterotopic Monstrosity: The Host and Godzilla, 105-129 \\n\\nWeek 3 \u2013 The science fiction cityscape \\nHao Jingfang, \u201cFolding Beijing\u201d \\nMarilyn Fabe, \u201cFilm Glossary\u201d \\nLiao, Wang. \\"The Alienation of Spaces in Future China: The Case of Hao Jingfang\'s Folding Beijing.\\" Comparative Literature Studies, Vol. 57, No. 4, 2020, 686-701.  \\n\\nWeek 4 \u2013 Science fiction and Lost love \\nWong Kar Wai, 2046 \\nDonna Haraway: \u201cA Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s,\u201d 1-37 \\n\\nWeek 5 - Politics of the Cyborg self \\nMamoru Oshii, Ghost in the Shell (1995) \\nChristopher Bolton, Chapter 3 Puppet Voices, Cyborg Souls; pg 95-128 \\n\\nWeek 6 \u2013 Science fiction and Trauma \\nJang Joon-hwan, Save the Green Planet \\nChu, Seo-young.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives\\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\\n---\\nCourse Materials:\\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas. Please do note that the course materials should be used for personal studying purpose. This means you must not upload or share them onto the public sites such as Facebook, Google sites and so on.\\nMain references\\nThe following two books will be used in the course depending on the topics of interest.\\n[1].

This course is reading- and writing-intensive and is organized as a series of discussions. This course focuses on two main aspects: (i) the analysis of economic inequalities and (ii) the interaction between inequality and economic development. It will address the following questions from a theoretical perspective and/or an empirical perspective: \\n1. How does inequality evolve over time, and how does the evolution of inequality couple with the dynamics of economic development? \\n2. What are the determinants of inequality, and which theories can account for the level of economic inequalities and its dynamics?  \\n3. Which public policies can reduce inequality and foster equitable growth?  \\n4. How quickly does the level of inequality respond to a change in a public policy? \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nMajor Learning Outcomes (MLO): Students in the Economics major will:  \\nMLO1: Apply economic analysis to everyday problems, evaluate policies and the data supporting them, investigate arguments, and analyze the world in terms of trade-offs and incentives.\\nMLO2: Collect, interpret, and manipulate quantitative data to address real-world problems.\\nMLO3: Display a command of existing knowledge by explaining key economic theories and concepts and describing how they can be used.\\nMLO4: Work in and lead teams; ensure students can navigate diverse audiences and environments.\\nMLO5: Create new knowledge by identifying and formulating a question on some economic issue that will facilitate its investigation.\\nMLO6: Prepare for masters or doctoral programs in Economics or related disciplines such as Public Policy and Data Science at top-tier international programs.\\n\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO): Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nCLO1: Explain the key concepts of inequality such as the Gini coefficient, the coefficient of variation, the Pareto measure of inequality, the top income/wealth shares, and so on.  \\nCLO2: Develop a critical approach of the data and methods used to measure inequality.\\nCLO3: Analyze the determinants and consequences of economic inequality using appropriate theoretical models and empirical data.\\nCLO4: Evaluate the effectiveness of public policies used to combat inequality.  \\nCLO5: Propose appropriate policies to deal with inequality and promote equitable growth.\\nCLO6: Conduct independent research, especially on economic inequality.  \\nCLO7: Collaborate and work in teams effectively.\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\nPART 1: CORE CONCEPTS \\nWeek 1: Introduction \\nReadings:  \\nBenjamin, D., Brandt, L., & McCaig, B.

The aim of this course is to develop an understanding of the basic concepts of robotics, focusing on the construction and programming of autonomous mobile robots. The course uses a studio-based approach that tightly combines instruction in theory with practical implementation. After a review of recent developments in robotics, students are introduced to fundamental concepts related to robot mechanics, kinematics, sensor systems, and motion control. They are then introduced to high-level concepts related to robot intelligence such as path planning, localization, and map building. Students are also taught essential concepts and skills of programming. Both the robotic concepts and programming skills are reinforced as they work in a supervised, hands-on, team-based project. In this project, students work in teams to apply the conceptual knowledge and skills that they have acquired to the task of building and programming a robot in hands-on sessions. Students develop their project in the framework of the engineering design process\u2014from the analysis of requirements and initial design to implementation and testing. The course concludes with a contest designed for the robots developed by students. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO):\\nAfter completing the course, students will be able to \\nCLO1: Understand fundamental concepts of intelligent robot systems that will help them better understand the design and development challenges in the field of robotics. \\nCLO2: Strengthen their engineering skills involved in the design, construction and control of robots. \\nCLO3: Deepen their grasp of programming concepts and their programming skills. \\nCLO4: Gain hands-on practice in building and programming an actual robot. \\nCLO5: Program an autonomous mobile robot to achieve challenging tasks. \\nCLO6: Work as a team to complete different learning tasks that include practical and team assignments \\nCLO7: Effectively communicate their results via professional report writing and presentation \\nCLO8: Sharpens their analytical, planning, presentation and teamwork skills  \\n\\nEngineering Major Learning Outcomes (MLO):\\nMLO1: Analytical thinking: Identify, formulate, analyze and decompose complex engineering problems along with available resources and authentic constraints using principles of mathematics, basic sciences and engineering sciences.

Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age? How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. The aim of this course is to understand the big forces that pull the world\u2019s parts together as well as those that drive them apart. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects you to students elsewhere in the world.

Since then, it has become the leading global power, whose foreign policy not only disproportionately impacts other nations, but shapes the very structure of the international system. A grasp of American diplomatic history has become indispensable to anyone wishing to understand international politics from the beginning of the 20th century onwards.\\nThis course examines the evolution of American foreign policy through the 20th century, covering all the major events and debates of that time period, including the American decision to intervene in World War I and its consequences; the impact of America\u2019s isolationist foreign policy during the interwar years; the causes and consequences of World War II; the origins of the Cold War and American strategy; the creation and collapse of the American-led postwar economic system; American relations with allies and enemies in the Third World; and the United States in the post-Cold War World. We will also explore a range of macro-themes, including the role of ideology, race, religion, domestic politics, the institutional environment, and individual leaders in the making of American foreign policy.\\nThe goal of the course is to introduce students to the study of American foreign policy after 1898. Students will become familiar with important events, personalities, and theoretical perspectives. Students will be introduced to a range of opinions through secondary sources and trained to properly evaluate and use primary sources. Students will be expected to integrate these sources to produce two medium-length essays of five double-spaced pages each, with clear structures, coherent arguments supported by evidence where appropriate, and correct citation. Students will come away from the course with improved critical reading and argumentative writing skills, which are highly valued in most careers in an information economy.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\\n1. Identify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\\n2. Explain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\\n3. Explain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\\n4. Explain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\\n5. Propose solutions to current challenges in dealing with the US in the world\\n6. Critically analyze and interpret primary sources\\n7.

During this timespan, the wars in Vietnam evolved from anti-colonial struggle to superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As the struggle for Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states, citizens\u2019 movements, and other non-state actors whose interpretations and responses to the war were conditioned by a variety of competing local agendas.  \\nThis course will assess critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese, origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers commit so much to a small, distant country? What role did the larger Cold War play in shaping overseas powers\u2019 decision-making? What was impact of each party\u2019s respective domestic politics? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? How did it shape the politics and economy of the region? And what are the global legacies of the war?  \\nThe course will consider the Vietnam War as first and foremost a Vietnamese conflict, one which acquired increasingly global significance. In addition to exploring the domestic causes and dynamics of the Vietnam War, we will also consider the conflict - a seminal episode in the global Cold War - as a lens for analyzing a wide range of international events and trends. These include Empire and Decolonization; the Non-Aligned Movement; the Chinese Civil War; the American \u201cRed Scare\u201d; the Korean War; Development and Modernization Theory; the Sino-Soviet Split; China\u2019s Cultural Revolution; Detente; the rise of the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d; the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian Genocide; and the aftermaths, legacies, and interpretations of the conflict. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO): On completion of this module, students should be able to do the following (numbers of Major Learning Outcomes are attached in parentheses; see list of MLOs below): \\nCLO1: Identify the principal causes of the Vietnam War (MLO 1) \\nCLO2: Explore the factors prompting global powers to intervene, including the United States, France, the Soviet Union, South Korea, China, and Cambodia.

Students will familiarize themselves with the works of key communist figures from around the globe in the historical and political contexts in which they lived and struggled. By showcasing the incredible diversity of communist theories, systems, experiences, and personalities, while providing analytical tools and documentary resources, History of International Communism will help students grow as critical readers and knowledge producers through facilitating lively and informed debate and praxis of communist thought and history. In the end, the course will help students to reflect upon Vietnam\u2019s own communist past, present, and future under the specter of international communism with greater clarity and wisdom. The course will be accompanied by a parallel series of non-compulsory, bi-weekly film screenings at night open to all who want to attend, with limited opportunities to get extra credit via paper reflections. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will gain knowledge of the diverse historical influences and ways of theorizing and practicing communism in different times and places \\nStudents will apply their knowledge of the historical, socio-political, and personal context behind the development of communist theories and policies to evaluate the achievements and shortcomings of different historical communist experiments \\nStudents will be able to reflect upon and critique the way communism is viewed and practiced by their society and government \\nStudents will develop critical thinking and argumentative writing skills to formulate and defend their informed opinions about the theory and practice of communism and engage in praxis \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nSCHEDULE & READINGS:\\n(readings not on link are available here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xru5czvx6wpkjp9/AABkMiFAo1ZpfSrcbp3bmxMLa?dl=0) \\n Week 1: American utopian socialists and European revolutionaries \\nWhy were there so many \u201cintentional communities\u201d in 19th century America?

At least one 200-level course in History or Social Studies \\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCross-listed with Vietnamese Studies (VS) and Social Studies (SS)\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nWe tend to think of the world in terms of nations, kingdoms, and empires. What does the world look like from the margins between states? The field of borderland studies puts those margins at the center of inquiry. In this course, we will learn how historically \u201cfuzzy\u201d borderlands in the Asia Pacific region became precisely bordered lands, or in some cases, disputed territories, in our contemporary world. We will also read from ethnographies and histories of everyday life to gain a deeper appreciation of life on the edges of the state. Readings will address a broad swathe of Asia with an emphasis on the borderlands between various states and the Qing empire as well as its successor states, including the PRC. Case studies will include Japanese-Ainu relations, Chinese migration to the Mekong delta, the making of Siam\u2019s modern borders, territorial disputes in Kashmir and Tibet, journeys through Mongolia, everyday life along the China-Russia border, and more. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nIn this course, students will develop \\nCritical thinking skills: We will challenge conventional frameworks for thinking about geographical space and human communities\u2014particularly, we will think critically about the framework of the neatly-bounded nation-state. \\nReasoning skills: we will think intensively about the best way to balance different kinds of evidence, including textual primary sources, maps, and participant observation data, while revising our image of the past and present.  \\nCultural knowledge: We will consider how life varies from one borderland to the next, and how life in borderlands may differ from life in the interior of a state\u2014particularly in the metropole. \\nEffective communication: Students will develop their writing and oral presentation skills with a historiographical paper, a research paper, and a final presentation. \\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n\\nWeek 1: What does a \u201cBorderland\u201d Look Like? \\nReadings: Elizabeth Kimball Kendall, A Wayfarer in China, ch. 6, \u201cTachienlu.\u201d \\n Unit 1: Frontiers and Borderlands \\n Week 2: Origins of the Field: Perspectives from North America \\nFrederick Jackson Turner (1920), The Frontier in American History, chapter 1. \\nJeremy Adelman and Stephen Aron (1999), \u201cFrom Borderlands to Borders: Empires, Nation-States, and the Peoples in Between in North American History.\u201d \\n Week 3: Comparative Asian Perspectives \\nReadings: Michiel Baud and Willem Van Schendel (1997), \u201cToward a Comparative History of Borderlands.\u201d \\nC.

It then moves into the emulation and modification of the Spanish model by other Atlantic imperial powers, notably Britain and France, and the general hardening of caste lines which occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We also discuss the racial, religious and civilizational categories used by early modern missionaries, most notably the Jesuits, not only with respect to black and indigenous people in the New World but also with respect to civilizations encountered outside the domain of traditional imperialism in South, East, and Southeast Asia. We then discuss how these categories contributed to the formation of \u201cscientific\u201d racism and how the latter, in turn, intersected with a variety of nineteenth-century European and North American imperial and educational projects. We close by reading excerpts from postcolonial theorists who grapple explicitly with the concept of race and its future.  \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\n1. Understanding the difference between a historical paper and an historiographical paper; learning to read multiple scholarly opinions and heuristics and rapidly identify the differences between or among them; learning to mine information on the educational background and historiographical school, etc., of contemporary and past scholars (e.g. this person is a member of the Cambridge school of intellectual history and therefore focuses on ideas in context, while a social historian will think about the experiences of past people, especially past subaltern people, and so on); writing fluently in the key of historiography. \\nThis contributes to the general goals of the major in terms of getting students to think historically, do their own research, read a wide variety of English-language sources critically, and so on. In general, historiographical writing requires less research than historical writing, but it is also more difficult because history undergraduates are trained to think of peer-reviewed journal articles and academic books as the \u201cword of God.\u201d Unlearning that and treating scholars as fallible historical people who, nonetheless, have done more serious research than any history undergraduate takes time and effort, and students will have to learn to read secondary sources much more closely and critically than they would otherwise do in order to construct an historiographical argument. They will also need to learn how to do creative research on the author\u2019s own biographies, for example finding CVs on university websites, reading acknowledgements pages, digging up juvenilia, and perhaps even interviewing the authors.  \\n\\n2. Understanding the degree to which European imperialism in its early modern/modern incarnation devolved on a) the introduction of religious-civilizational hierarchies unknown in the Middle Ages, which collapsed, to varying degrees, into racial-biological hierarchies b) the relaxation of prohibitions on unfree labor introduced during the Middle Ages. While imperialism, xenophobia, and exploitation were of course rife in the Middle Ages, as in any era, they did not take the racial and casteist forms which proliferated under Western rule c. 1500-1970, although other forms of casteism existed. Students will try to understand what made the ideological and material conditions for centuries of mass exploitation on an unprecedented scale possible. This course will also try to distinguish among the concepts of emperorhood, empire, and imperialism in a comparative context, focusing on the conditions which led to almost every Western European state declaring itself to be an empire during the early modern era, even states without a monarch.  \\nGrappling with the problem of modernity and/or Western hegemony is a subject which inevitably comes up in history courses which deal with material after about 1450. While other courses may encourage students to think about these problematics in order, for example, to construct a heuristic for understanding longue-dur\xe9e processes like capitalism or secularization, this course encourages students to confront the political, economic and ideological mechanisms of Western-led modernity head on.  \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeeks 1, 2, 3: Early Iberian Imperialism  \\nFrancisco N\xfa\xf1ez Muley, translated by Vincent Barletta.

Students will learn to read and write historiographically while, where appropriate, bringing in historical evidence (e.g. primary sources) in order to reinforce historiographical claims. The main skill emphasized here is learning how to sort through scholarship, identify points where there is substantial scholarly disagreement, and try to identify the sources of those disagreements. This involves learning to skim large amounts of scholarship in order to identify historiographical disputes at a glance, which is an advanced skil.  \\nFour introductions to in-class reading, presented and written with a partner, 300-500 words each, collectively 20% of grade. This assignment is intended to foster presentation skills and group work skills. In the case of readings which are older and/or notable among scholars (e.g. Black Skin, White Masks), students will be expected to work together to attain a basic literacy in the reception and legacy on the work presented on, as well as any controversies it may have generated. Again, this involves thinking critically about scholarship, learning about it as an artifact rather than accepting its contents as the \u201cword of God.\u201d  \\nClass participation, 20% of grade. Students will by the time of their arrival in this class have some familiarity with seminar-style discussion, but the goal here is to perfect it, to use questions from the professor as a jumping-off point for classwide discussion and not a simple exam question with a right or wrong answer. Students will be graded in part on their ability to engage with others\u2019 participation.  \\nFive interviews, collectively worth 10% of grade, 10 minutes each. Students will pair with a different partner from their partner in the introductions assignment for this assignment. Partners will create a 10-minute recorded interview in which they discuss what they thought were the high points of the readings and discussions of the past week of class. Interviews will be submitted the following Monday. These interviews are casual and are intended to improve: comfort with casual conversation in English; critical recollection and engagement with the material without instructor prompting; and level of engagement and attention in the class meetings leading up to the creation of an interview. Dead space is discouraged but recording many times to get a podcast-quality conversation is unnecessary.

We will explore formalist as well as cultural and political approaches to literature, will practice different ways of reading and interpreting texts, and will investigate the broader social and intellectual implications of methods of literary analysis. We will pay special attention to modes of criticism drawing on structuralism and post-structuralism, feminist theory, queer theory, new historicism, and Marxist, psychoanalytic, and postcolonial critique. In all, the course will serve as a space in which students can learn about, and learn how to apply, literary theory to their understanding of texts, culture, and society.  \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nUpon course completion, students:\\nWill be able to explain the historical significance of several major approaches to literary analysis and their interrelationships\\nWill be able to identify and critically evaluate the aesthetic, cultural, and political implications of theoretical texts \\nWill demonstrate understanding of the ways in which theoretical texts respond to, and shape, their social, political, aesthetic, and intellectual moment \\nWill apply theoretical methods to literary texts in written and spoken formats\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nWriting Assignment #1: 20%\\nWriting Assignment #2: 25%\\nPresentation: 10%\\nWeekly Reading Response: 15%\\nParticipation: 30%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"}],"location":"Classrooms 6&7"},{"title":"Film, Fiction, and the Making of Modern Vietnams","id":"LIT303_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Yen Vu","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002TF5eeQAD/lit303fall2022s01","description":"Faculty: Yen Vu - E: yen.vu@fulbright.edu.vn\\nPre-requisite: 1) Complete all core courses; 2) LIT101 Foundations in Literary Studies; 3) LIT103 Critical Methods in Literary Studies; 4) At least one 200-level literature course.\\nCross-listed with Arts and Media Studies (ARTS)\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThis course examines film and short fiction as vehicles for the production of Vietnamese cultural identities in the modern era. The tumultuous modern history of Vietnam (marked by three major wars, political division, unification, the destruction of one state, plus subsequent massive emigration of southern populations all over the world, as well asnormalization of international relations, and remarkable economic growth) has forced time and again, a deep and sometimes soul-wrenching reassessment of Vietnamese identity. Massive emigration over the 1970s and \u201880s following the Vietnam War, further complicated the question of identity, leading to large diaspora communities abroad with divergent values, aesthetics, and traditions. Throughout these upheavals, theproduction of short fiction, film, and tv have provided Vietnamese artists with a mirror of contemplation, a space for reckoning, and a canvas for the portrayal of alternative visions of Vietnamese life, society, and culture. Our class will begin with a range of short fiction produced at the end of the French period, in a time when Vietnamese intellectuals were struggling to imagine a new Vietnam free of colonial rule. We will then turn to depictions of the Vietnam war, and scrutinize both how foreign gazes represented Vietnam as well as how Vietnamese artists portrayed their own societies during this fraught time. Finally, we will turn to the postwar period, examining film, tv, and literature from both the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and contemporary diaspora communities, and ask how these artists imagine Vietnam and its future, in a time when the wars that tore apart the country are receding in memory.  \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will :\\nObtain a working knowledge of Vietnam in relation to its colonial and modern history\\nThink critically about narrative structure and their epistemological contributions across different media\\nMake important intercultural and interdisciplinary connections beyond the region of Southeast Asia.\\nProduce critical responses and essays in various formats (podcast, essay, video)\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n\\nWeek 1: Introduction & Narrative\\n-The Narrative Arc: \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d (https://thenarrativearc.org/plot)\\n-Suggested: George Johnson, NY Times: \u201cA Widening world of Hand-picked Truths\u201d\\n\\nWeek 2: Identity, History, and the Western Gaze\\n-Jamieson, Understanding Vietnam, \u201cPreface\u201d\\n-Barthes, \u201cAn Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative,\u201d pp. 237-260\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Oliver Stone (1986), Platoon\\n\\nWeek 3: The chasm between old and new\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Vi\u1ec7t Linh, M\xea Th\u1ea3o, Th\u1eddi vang b\xf3ng\\n-Fiction: V\u0169 Tr\u1ecdng Ph\u1ee5ng, \u201cS\u1ed1 \u0110\u1ecf\u201d (\u201cDumb Luck\u201d)\\n\\nWeek 4: Beyond existing boundaries\\nJamieson, Understanding Vietnam, \u201cBattle of the Novels\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Khoa, L\xe0ng V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i ng\xe0y \u1ea5y (\u201cOnce Upon a Time in V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i Village\u201d)\\n-Fiction: Nh\u1ea5t Linh: \u0110i T\xe2y (\u201cGoing to France\u201d)\\n\\nWeek 5: Colonial vestiges\\n-Saada, Empire\u2019s Children, \u201cIntroduction\u201d pp. 1-3\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Kim Lef\xe8vre, White M\xe9tisse (including introduction)\\n\\nWeek 6: Interculturality and ambivalence\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Kim Lef\xe8vre, White M\xe9tisse\\n\\nWeek 7: Hope and Disillusionment\\n- Dror, \u201cLove, Hatred, and Heroism: Socializing children in North Vietnam duringWartime, 1965-\\n75\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Fiction: L\xea Minh Khu\xea, \u201cNh\u1eefng ng\xf4i sao xa x\xf4i\u201d (\u201cDistant Stars\u201d), \u201cBi k\u1ecbch nh\u1ecf\u201d (\u201cSmall Tragedy\u201d)\\n\\nWeek 8: Watching the Autumns go by\\n- Dror, \u201cRaising Vietnamese: War and youth in the South in early 1970s\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n- Nh\xe3 Ca, Olga Dror: Mourning Headband for Hu\u1ebf (Selections)\\n- Film: H\xe0 Th\xfac C\u1ea7n, \u0110\xe2t Kh\u1ed5 (\u201cLand of Sorrows\u201d)\\n- The music of Tr\u1ecbnh C\xf4ng S\u01a1n\\n\\nWeek 9: A Hard Morning\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh, Bao gi\u1edd cho \u0111\u1ebfn th\xe1ng m\u01b0\u1eddi (\u201cWhen October Comes\u201d)\\n- Fiction: Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do\\n\\nWeek 10: The Silence of Defeat\\n- Kilbourne, Cinema, Memory, Modernity, Introduction\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Ham Tran, V\u01b0\u1ee3t s\xf3ng (\u201cJourney from the Fall\u201d)\\n-Fiction: Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do\\n\\nWeek 11: Art and relics of history\\n- Nguyen, Khai Tu, \u201cCai Luong and the Politics of North and South Vietnam\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n- Film: Leon L\xea, Song Lang\\n\\nWeek 12: Memory and Family history\\n- Fiction: Nguyen Phan Que Mai, The Mountains Sing\\n\\nWeek 13: Reimaginations\\n- Fiction: Nguyen Phan Que Mai, The Mountains Sing\\n\\nWeek 14: Diversification and Exploration\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Charlie Nguy\u1ec5n, Ch\xe0ng v\u1ee3 c\u1ee7a em (\u201cMy Mr. Wife\u201d)\\n-Film: Swann Dubus, Trong hay ngo\xe0i tay em (\u201cWith or Without Me\u201d)\\n\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nAttendance and participation\\nPresentation\\nCreative Reflection\\nMid-term paper\\nFinal project","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"}],"location":"Classroom 1"},{"title":"Pacific Voyages in Literature & Film","id":"LIT305_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Isadora Wagner","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002THKU2QAP/lit305fall2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Isadora Wagner - E: isadora.wagner@fulbright.edu.vn\\nOffice Hours: Office hours are available on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8:00 \u2013 9:30AM or by appointment.

The course moves chronologically through four periods and pairs key works in literature with cinematic adaptations. In Part I: Early Precursors (1400s-1700s), we consider epics, epistles, encyclopedic compendiums, first-person travelogues, and imaginative plays that precede the novel and shape its development through their tales of far-off peoples, lands, adventures, risks, and riches in the Pacific. Part II: The Novel studies the emergence and generic conventions of arguably two of the very earliest English novels\u2014Daniel Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels (1726)\u2014out of true-life tales of mutiny, shipwreck, island maroonage, cultural contact, and rescue. \\nBuilding on these themes, and noting the increasing imperialism and internationalism of the modern era, the third section considers two famous novels of the long nineteenth century\u2014Benito Cereno (1855), American author Herman Melville\u2019s short novel about a revolt on a slave ship in the Pacific off the coast of Chile, and Heart of Darkness (1899), English novelist Joseph Conrad\u2019s cautionary tale of colonialism, madness, and greed in the Dutch Congo, told from the viewpoint of Marlow, a Pacific sea captain, to an unnamed narrator on a boat. The last course section examines the role of the Pacific in the formation of early cinema and ongoing representations in literature and film today, including through the novels of Indian writer Amitav Ghosh (The Glass Palace, 2002), Hawaiian writer Kiana Davenport (House of Many Gods, 2007), and the films Apocalypse Now Redux (1979/2001), Amistad (1997), Castaway (2000), and Waikiki (2020). \\n\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of the course, students will be able to:\\nSuccessfully employ close reading and interpretive analysis skills when making evidence-based arguments about literary and filmic texts and other visual media. \\nApply the language and critical approaches of travel narratives, transnationalism, cultural studies, and literary studies when examining and discussing fictionalized, autobiographical, and factual portrayals of transpacific oceanic travel. \\nWork comparatively, critically, and deconstructively across genres, mediums, and geographies to account for patterns in portrayals of self, other, and nation when examining narratives of Pacific voyages.\\nCritically assess distinctions between different genres of cultural representations, including their limits, effects, and public reception; for example, between a short story and a graphic memoir or a documentary and a Hollywood film.\\nGain confidence in presenting original research and ideas in a public setting before a cohort of peers and faculty.\\n---\\nRequired Texts & Materials \u2013 The primary texts and films for this course are listed below.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \\nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \\nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2VW_ACdTlNzySiySyfPfOrgxQztprrzGxxL_2pfo5Q/edit?usp=sharing \\nSummary \\nUnit One: Foundational Questions \u2013 This unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. The primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. Each week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d This unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \\n Unit Two: The Human Experience \u2013 This unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. Each week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis. Different iterations of the class can select form a list of topics depending upon the instructor\u2019s preference. These topics include: Food, Sex, Death, Wealth, Nations, Power, Religion, Language, Law, Morality, Race.

We are spending more time and effort in borderless cyberspace but at the same time, dealing with issues in the multicultural physical space. Technology and society co-evolve, thus making it essential to understand both in order to grasp the best opportunities and also prepare for the upcoming challenges that arise from the ever increasing integration of technologies into our societies. While a discussion takes place among experts and in academia, foremost in the domain of Science and Technology Studies (STS), on the current and future social, economic, moral, legal, and political consequences, to the broader public, including early-stage students, these technologies and their implications can often remain abstract terms. One might have heard about IT, AI, big data, the Internet of Things, deep learning, or blockchain. Buzz words that we find frequently used in the international media. This course discusses these technologies, and systemically, in various sections throughout the semester, examines the social, ethical, moral, economic, political, and legal implications these technologies have and will have on societies globally. It will address critical societal challenges such as privacy, cybersecurity, misinformation, governance and politics in the digital age, media, business stability, ethics and morals in the digital age, and new modes of the workforce, among others. We will also look at internet governance as well as privacy protection rules in a global context for better understanding of global trends in building healthy relations between technology and society. Throughout, the course aims to educate students to think critically about the approaches and possible solutions to the challenges in the physical and virtual domain. The course serves as an introduction to these technologies and a moderate foray into Science and Technology Studies\' academic discipline. It should enable students to understand better the underlying technologies and the value of Science and Technology Studies (STS) while hopefully further arising interest in these subjects and into this academic discipline \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nGiven an introduction into the field of Science and Technology Studies.\\nProvide an understanding how academic profession studies technologies and technological changes.\\nUnderstand the complex relationship between technology, sciences and society\\nAnalyze important trends about the way and nature of current and emerging technological developments, allowing to gain an understanding on how technologies could develop further.\\nUnderstand the complex relationships between technology, sciences, innovation, economic, political and social dynamics, and societies\\nUnderstand how and why technology advancements have modified the physical and virtual environment of human societies\\nEnhance students\u2019 ability to approach complex problems critically, systematically and innovatory\\nDevelop students\u2019 capacity to position themselves in the emerging civilization age \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1: Class Introduction.

In Vietnam, several intriguing projects founded on DH applications have been carried out by Vietnamese museums, cultural heritage preservation offices, and higher education institutions. \\n\\"Digital Humanities in Vietnam Studies Contexts\u201d is specifically designed and offered in collaboration between Fulbright University and Vin University (hereafter \u201cVinUni\u201d). By nature, it is a connected course, in which students and instructors from the two institutions work on the same syllabus, mutually learning from each other, teaming up and teamworking together through various stages of a project of their team\u2019s choice. The course provides its students with basic knowledge of digital humanities, computational tools and interdisciplinary methods, and shows them how to apply them in research in social sciences and humanities in general and in Vietnam\u2019s contexts in particular.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nSpecifically, by the end of the course, students should be able to \\nRaise questions in research in the field of the humanities and social sciences, and search for solutions with the help from computer science. \\nRecognize potentialities for interdisciplinary DH (research) project \\nIdentify characteristics of DH in terms of interdisciplinary of computer science and the humanities. \\nCreate roadmaps of the DH circle of processing and interpretation (acquisition, processing, analysis, visualization, UX, interpretation). \\nDesign and conduct a DH project step-by-step from data acquisition to new understandings on a simple humanities dataset, \\nIdentify and describe copyrights of multiple datasets, as well as suggestions to use them appropriately, \\nDigitize, process, and interpret written documents by using fundamental text understand methods \\nDigitize, process, and interpret images, using fundamental code snippets of optical characterizing recognition \\nDigitize, process, and interpret sounds and music, using fundamental code snippets of speech processing \\nImplement, test and validate annotation dataset by using multiple crowdsourcing platforms, \\nAnalyze and explain the basic steps of simple projects involving DH: acquisition, processing, analysis, visualization, UX, interpretation, \\nSynthesize necessary steps to understand humanities datasets \\nChoose appropriate pipeline constructs for a given DH task \\nApply the techniques of decomposition to break a DH project into smaller stages, \\nDescribe the concept of digital humanities and give examples of its applications, \\nApply consistent theories and practical pipelines that contribute to the development of DH projects. \\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus:\\nWeek 1:1 \\nWelcome and Introduction to the Course \\nNiels Bruggers. \u201cDigital Humanities in the 21st Century: Digital Material as a Driving Force.\u201d 2016, Volume 10 Number 3.

It seeks to examine different theoretical perspectives on social movements and meanwhile exposes students to empirical studies of movements across the world, in both democratic and non-democratic states, with an emphasis on Vietnam. The key questions we will examine include the following: When and why do social movements occur? How are movements organized? What do movement participants think and feel? How do social movements work? How do authorities respond to movements? Why do movements decline? What changes do movements bring about? How do Vietnamese social movements emerge and grow? Any challenges ahead for Vietnamese civil society?\\nThe course will be divided into two main parts. The first devoted to theories of social movements and the ways in which our understanding of social movements has changed over time. We will also examine mobilization to social movements and ask why some people come to participate while others do not as well as the tactics  and successes of various social movements. The second is reserved for discussion of Vietnam\'s nascent social movements. There will be also experiential learning format in the course through which students will have the chance to visit an NGO in Ho Chi Minh City.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nAt the end of this course, the student will be able to:\\nExplain the main theories and concepts used in class.\\nLearn the analytic tools necessary to examine and critically assess the role of social movements in our society.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned in class to better understand historical and modern social movement causes and campaigns.\\nDesign a research project that incorporates a clear hypothesis, literature review, and data analysis on the topic of social movements.\\nCritically analyze and evaluate published research.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned to analyze emerging civil society and social movements in Vietnam\\nDevelop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nCourse Readings: There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Canvas and consist of book chapters and journal articles that either discuss key theoretical paradigms used in the study of social movements and/or apply them to specific social movements.\\n\\nWeek 1: Introduction: Conceptualizing Social Movements\\nTilly, Charles.

No freshmen allowed.\\n*Cross-listed with History (HIS), Social Studies (SS), and Literature (LIT).\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nIn this two-semester course (identified as Honors Praxis lab at the University of Utah, hereafter \u201cUU\u201d), students will engage in deep, critical analysis of the American War in Viet Nam and critically examine the war\u2019s legacies across the sites of mind, body, culture, family, environment, politics, and memory. The American War in Vietnam was a pivotal event of the 20th century. As time has passed and its survivors aged into late adulthood, we have reached a critical time to reflect upon that war\u2019s legacy and to engage in conversations with those who experienced and survived it. Their experiences hold insights into war\u2019s true toll, and the means to survive, recover, and reconcile in the wake of war. Unique to this course will be a transnational, multiplex consideration of war\u2019s legacies across diverse populations who experienced that war on \u201cmany sides,\u201d including Vietnamese and American participants in the fighting, protestors against the fighting, and a wide range of noncombatants who, despite being on the \u201cmargins\'\' of the fighting, nonetheless experienced war\u2019s toll. We will critically discuss how experiences of war and post-war migrations between countries constitute diasporic connections between Vietnam and America today. Through readings, films, guest lectures, and our own conversations, we will develop an appreciation of military veterans\u2019 and noncombatants\u2019 experiences \u2013 their memories of war, experiences of trauma, and sources of resilience. We will also consider the intergenerational and international connections \u2013 of suffering, resilience, and healing \u2013 that have arisen out of the American War in Vietnam. \\n\\nThis will be offered consecutively in two semesters, Fall 2022 & Spring 2023. The first semester is the time to provide students with multi perspective viewpoints of the war and its legacy, helping them to build a theoretical foundation for further research. The second semester will be conducted in a seminar style, as Fulbright-Utah students have figured out a research topic for their year-end final project. It will provide students with significant hands-on experience as it will lead them through various research phases, and show them how to present the outcomes of each phase effectively to an academic audience. Joint seminars will be conducted with the participation of all students from the two institutions.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\n-    Build a foundational knowledge of the geopolitical context, chronology, key figures, and events of the American War in Vietnam to situate that war\u2019s legacies. \\n-    Develop awareness of the linked cultures, social relations, and histories spanning the U.S. and Viet Nam that emerged through war, and an understanding of one another as populations whose lives are shaped and interconnected by war; \\n-   Comprehend how the American War in Vietnam, and other wars, have left enduring legacies upon critical sites of body, mind, culture, landscape, ecology, & society. This involves an appreciation of the many sides engaged in the war and the diaspora/transnational communities created by war.  \\n-    Engage in critical discussion and analysis of data, artifacts, and methodologies for describing and explaining war legacies, the strengths and shortcomings of these approaches, the experiences to which they give voice, and silence. \\n-    Through regular interaction and completion of shared assignments with team members at Fulbright University Vietnam and the University of Utah and, hone skills in cross-cultural awareness and communication, virtual collaboration, and team approaches to knowledge production. \\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule:\\nWeek 1  \\nReview syllabus \\nOverview of course - themes, structure, assessment, Fulbright-Utah Student Teaming Up. \\nThematic Focus: Diverse perspectives and diverse legacies of the American/Vietnam War \\n\\nReadings: \\nGeorge Katsiaficas, ed.

Based on the complexity of the theories such as intertextuality, translation studies, cultural studies, deconstruction, and reception theory, adaptation studies allow audiences to consider the film adaptations as independent films with respective creativities of filmmakers by their cinematic language. Because adaptation studies are interdisciplinary, this course will not only instruct students on how to read books and movies but also move beyond comparisons of sources and film adaptations. Adaptation studies can be considered as a methodology and a field. Therefore, the class will concentrate on communicating film adaptations with the texts they are adapting. During the term, students will practice analyzing several Asian film adaptations to illuminate adaptation studies and learn about the Asian cultural contexts surrounding the sources and their adaptations. The outstanding feature of the course is that students will understand what film adaptations show and do not show in comparison with their sources to break the notion of fidelity that limit the filmmakers\u2019 creativities in their adaptation process. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to meet some guest speakers who are Vietnamese filmmakers, such as Viet Linh, Phan Gia Nhat Linh, Vinh Son, Nguyen Vo Nghiem Minh to listen to their own experiences about adaptation. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to: \\nBe able to analyze a film adaptation and write critically about how film adaptation reflects filmmakers\u2019 point of view and the context. \\nInterpreting why the filmmaker changed and revised the source literary work. \\nUnderstanding the equal relationship between literature and cinema \\nPrepare and submit their essay in appropriate research. \\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule:\\n\\nWeek 1.

It will provide you with an introduction to Vietnamese Studies, which is both an interdisciplinary field and a transnational community of scholars and students in Vietnam and across the world. The course incorporates scholarship and methods from multiple disciplines, with particular attention to History, Environmental Studies, and Literary and Film Studies. These interdisciplinary investigations will be linked by our focus on the theme of development in Vietnam. In this course, we will analyze development historically and contextually; we will also seek to understand it not simply as an economic process, but also as a political, social, and ideological category.\\nThis course inaugurates a new collaborative learning partnership between Dartmouth College, a member of the Ivy League founded in 1769, and Fulbright University Vietnam, a liberal arts university established in Ho Chi Minh City in 2016. Throughout the fall 2020 term, you and your Fulbright classmates will be interacting and co-learning with a group of American students enrolled in a similar course at Dartmouth. Our two courses will function as a single \u201cconnected course,\u201d co-designed and co-taught by Dartmouth and Fulbright faculty, and using a common syllabus.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents who successfully complete this course will:\\nGain an introductory knowledge of the field of Vietnamese Studies and the major theoretical and practical issues in the field;\\nConstruct a working definition of the meaning of development, informed by the critical perspectives developed by scholars in History, Environmental Studies, Literary and Film Studies, and other fields;\\nInvestigate key questions in the study of the recent history of development in Vietnam (especially since the 1980s);\\nInvestigate key questions in the study of environmental governance in contemporary Vietnam, especially as it relates to development;\\nInvestigate how development has been represented, celebrated, and critiqued in contemporary Vietnamese literature and film;\\nWork in a team composed of Dartmouth and Fulbright University students to design and execute a research project on some aspect of development in contemporary Vietnam;\\nCollaborate with their teammates to produce a short film that presents the main findings of their research project.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance: 5%\\nParticipation: 10%\\nOne-on-one interview assignment: 5%\\nOnline Field Journal: 10%\\nDartmouth-Fulbright Team Research Project: 60%\\nSummative Reflection paper: 10%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"11:00:00"}],"location":"Classrooms 8&9"},{"title":"Contending Theories of International Relations: A Comprehensive View of Vietnam","id":"VS215_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Nguyen Thanh Trung","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002TF5f5QAD/vs215fall2022s01","description":"Faculty: Nguyen Thanh Trung - E: trung.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisite: Completed any 100-level History of Vietnam Studies courses\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n*Cross-listed with Social Studies (SS)\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThis course brings together International Relations theory and real-world Vietnamese foreign policy decisions and outcomes. The primary goal is to give students conceptual and critical tools to understand and analyze how theories of international relations, Vietnamese foreign policy outcomes, and current political events fit together. The course pays attention to the application of international relations theories to the problems we study, and also takes an interest in policy issues facing decision-makers in Vietnam as well as those facing decision-makers in other countries who deal with Vietnam. It is designed to develop students\u2019 capacity both to explain the foreign policy-making process in Vietnam, and to better understand the underlying patterns, logic, and implications of Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy in the world at large. \\nThe course is divided into three main topics. First, we will discuss International Relations theory that grounds Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy by examining the core international relations paradigms: realism, liberalism and social constructivism. It presents their historical origins, the evolution of their various branches (classical realism, neo-realism, neo-liberal institutionalism, etc.), and studies the contemporary application of the most important theories in the field. The second part of the class will examine the peculiar institutions and processes that guide foreign policy formation and implementation. Questions will revolve around who set the foreign policy agenda and what are the important institutions attempting to implement this agenda. Finally, the last third of the course will review some of the major elements and the more salient foreign policy challenges facing Vietnam since 1975. We seek to understand the security-based rationale of policy as well as other factors \u2013 institutional, ideological cultural, perceptual, and so on \u2013 that influence Vietnamese foreign policy. We also analyze decision-making processes that shape Vietnamese foreign policy, and Vietnam\u2019s relations with various countries and regions. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nExplain the major theories of international relations (hereinafter IR). \\nIdentify and describe the main similarities and differences among the major IR theories. \\nIdentify the leading authors in the IR field, as well as the theories, seminal works and key concepts they are associated with. \\nUnderstand the historical evolution of IR theory over time. \\nApply theoretical frameworks to understanding practical international relations issues. \\nAssess the behavior of actors in international politics in light of IR theories. \\nEnhance the students\u2019 understanding of contemporary Vietnamese foreign policy (hereinafter VFP) and its historical development through the study of Vietnam\u2019s relations with major countries and regions of the world, and also exploring the key issues in these relations. \\nProvide students with structured knowledge of VFP and enable them to independently explain VFP decisions by presenting the key principles and factors shaping VFP. \\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule:\\n\\nWeek 1: Course Introduction + What is Theory?  \\n- Stephen Walt. 2005. \u201cThe Relationship between Theory and Policy in International Relations.\u201d Annual Review of Political Science (8): 23-48.  \\n- Stephen Walt. 1998. \u201cOne World, Many Theories.\u201d Foreign Policy (Spring): 25-35.  \\n- Jack Snyder. 2004. \u201cOne World, Rival Theories.\u201d Foreign Policy.

They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture.

We will also explore important technical and theoretical concepts associated with the moving image, such as editing, dialectic, representation, and protest. We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage.

Considering the idea of gender as performance, we will investigate\u2014in literature and film\u2014various performances of gender and question how they operate and function under oppressive and regulatory structures, what Butler calls a \u201cregime of sexuality.\u201d Focusing on literature, film, and other media produced from the East Asian context, we will also investigate gender and sexuality along with critical questions regarding power, performance, nationalism, and modernization. Many of the texts and moving-image media we will read and watch together will come from various genres of comedy, melodrama, musical, and speculative fiction. Many of them also feature coming-of-age narratives against the backdrop and violence of war, migration, or rapid urbanization and technological change. Together, we will practice close analysis and critical interpretation while reading essays and fiction by 20th and 21st century writers including Xiao Hong, Eileen Chang, Sang. Young Park, and Chi Ta-wei. We will practice formal analysis while screening and discussing films directed by Toshio Matsumoto, Wong Kar-wai, Park Chan-wook, and Sung Hsin-yin.

Beyond the popular understanding of curating as exhibition-making, this course will focus on what it means to curate as a critical and creative practice, and how curators conceive of stories and concepts within specific contexts. By reading texts, surveying key exhibitions, meeting guest speakers, visiting art spaces, and doing hands-on assignments and practical training, students will explore the traditional, artistic, and multidisciplinary possibilities of curating.\\nWe will learn about the influences, controversies, and thresholds of curatorship within different contexts, both historical and geographical, aesthetic and political. Saigon will serve as a local context of curating practice, as demonstrated through notable exhibitions from the modern postcolonial nation-building period of the late 1950s, and the post-Doi Moi period of the early 2000s to present.\\nThrough such case studies, we will analyze how exhibitions intersect with political representation and aesthetic developments, and investigate in more depth how one can curate between different contexts, such as from the urban to the rural; from the national to the regional to the international; and from a historical perspective to that of the future.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to:\\n1.

This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future. Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

In this course we will put economics in the context of how it analyzes and addresses real-world issues such as inequality, discrimination, and sustainability through the interplay of data and theory. While this course will be challenging, no prior knowledge of economics, statistics, or computer programming is assumed.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLOs): By the end of this course, students will be able to:\\n1. explain economics notions such as capitalism, fairness, and rationality.\\n2. conduct empirical research using Excel.\\n3. analyze labor and goods markets using appropriate economic models.\\n4. evaluate different public policy approaches to correcting incomplete markets.\\n5. critique economic theory with experimental evidence. 6. debate contemporary ideas in economic thought and research.\\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule\\nTextbook: The Economy\\nWeek 1: Introduction/ COVID and the Economy Readings: None\\nWeek 2: The Capitalist Revolution Readings: The Economy, Chapter 1\\nWeek 3: Technology, Population, and Growth Readings: The Economy, Chapter 2\\nWeek 4: Scarcity, Work, and Choice Readings: The Economy, Chapter 3\\nWeek 5: Social Interactions Readings: The Economy, Chapter 4\\nWeek 6: Property and Power: Mutual Gains and Conflict Readings: The Economy, Chapter 5\\nWeek 7: Diagnostic #1 Readings: None\\nWeek 8: The Firm: Owners, Managers, and Employees Readings: The Economy, Chapter 6\\nWeek 9: The Firm and its Customers Readings: The Economy, Chapter 7\\nWeek 10: Supply and Demand: Price-taking and Competitive Markets Readings: The Economy, Chapter 8\\nWeek 11: Markets, Efficiency, and Public Policy Readings: The Economy, Chapter 12\\nWeek 12: Diagnostic #2 Readings: None\\nWeek 13: Course Wrap-up Readings: None\\n---\\nAssessment & Grading:\\nQuizzes: 20%\\nHomework: 20%\\nExperiments: 20%\\nDiagnostics: 30%","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"11:30:00","end_time":"13:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"11:30:00","end_time":"13:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 502"},{"title":"Principles of Economics 2","id":"ECON103_Spring2023_S02","credits":"4","instructor":"Hoang Van Khieu","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002X87PsQAJ/econ103spring2023s02","description":"Faculty: Khieu Van Hoang\\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisite: No. Some basic mathematical background is assumed.\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course engages with questions related to the economy as a whole.

This introductory course is divided into two parts. The first part of this course focuses on philanthropic giving while the second part focuses on philanthropic effectiveness. Key questions to be examined in part one include why and how people give (time, money, skills, etc.). Key questions to be examined in part two include why and how to evaluate philanthropic effectiveness. In addition, students will be invited to consider how government policy influences giving and effectiveness. As students explore these questions, they will draw upon academic scholarship from multiple disciplines ranging from psychology and economics to ethics and philosophy. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nMajor learning outcomes:\\nApply economic analysis to everyday problems, evaluate policies and the data supporting them, investigate arguments, and analyze the world in terms of trade-offs and incentives. \\nCollect, interpret, and manipulate quantitative data to address real-world problems. \\nDisplay a command of existing knowledge by explaining key economic theories and concepts and describing how they can be used. \\nWork in and lead teams; ensure students can navigate diverse audiences and environments. \\nCreate new knowledge by identifying and formulating a question on some economic issue that will facilitate its investigation. \\nPrepare for masters or doctoral programs in Economics or related disciplines such as Public Policy and Data Science at top-tier international program\\nCourse learning outcomes:\\nBy the end of this course students will be able to: \\nUnderstand the role of philanthropy in society\\nExplain different reasons for giving. \\nIdentify desirable philanthropic outcomes for different stakeholders. \\nEvaluate and critique different methods used to measure social change. \\nDesign a philanthropic strategy for an organization. \\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n\\nWeek \\nTopic \\nReadings \\n1 \\nWhat is philanthropy? \\nSchein (2009) \u201cWhat is help?\u201d Chapter 1 in Helping: How to offer, give, and receive help, Understanding effective dynamics in one-to-one, group, and organizational relationships \\n2 \\nPerspectives on philanthropy \\nGiridharadas, Anand.

Accountability, school choice, charter schools, vouchers, privatization, merit pay for teachers, and school funding are just a few noteworthy examples. This course will explore how economists think about education in general as well as these specific policies and the underlying economic theories. We will address the following questions:\\n* What concepts, theories, perspectives, methods, and insights do economists bring to education policy debates, in both K-12 and higher education?\\n* How is economic thinking used to support and/or oppose specific educational policies? To what extent and in what ways does school choice \u201cincrease competition\u201d among schools? Is there a teacher shortage? If so, how might it be eliminated? How can schools attract high quality teachers? Do too many, or too few, students go on to college?\\n* What are the most important research studies conducted by economists of education? What have these contributed to our understanding of education? The readings are mostly drawn from the extensive literature on the U.S. education system, but many issues are universally relevant, and students are encouraged to make connections to their own experience and the Vietnamese education system.\\n---\\nCourse learning outcomes (CLOs): By the end of the course, the students should be able to:\\nCLO1: explain the key economic concepts and models relevant to education and describe their specific applications in educational issues\\nCLO2: explain how economists approach educational issues and how the economic approach to education differs from that of sociologists and other education researchers.\\nCLO3: understand the key policy issues in education and pose relevant questions whose answers help inform these issues\\nCLO4: evaluate the effectiveness of different education policies and propose appropriate policies to address educational issues.\\nCLO5: conduct independent research on educational issues.\\nCLO6: collaborate and work in teams effectively\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\nThere is no textbook for this course.

By definition, a signal is any observable change in quantity over space or time. It could help observers to obtain information about a phenomenon. In nature, signals can be actions done by organisms to alert other organisms or sounds or motions by animals to alert other animals of danger or food. Advances in technology have improved the capabilities of human beings to identify, analyze and even synthesize diverse information sources such as audio (speech, acoustics, music), image (photos, videos, multimedia, medical scans), medical signals (heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity) and remote sensing data (geophysical, sensing, radar). In principle, signals could be represented as data values or abstractly as mathematical expressions. A system converts or manipulate an input signal into an output signal. Examples of systems are face recognition, video streaming, cellular phones, and smart homes. In this course, students will learn to use mathematical theory and computer simulation to develop models, to analyze and to manipulate signals and systems that vary in continuous-time and discrete time. Specifically, the course covers representation of signals and systems, systems properties, conversion between continuous-time and discrete-time, Laplace, Fourier and z-transforms, transfer functions, frequency responses, convolution, stability, feedback and control systems. Students will gain hands-on experience on how to process various types of signals and to analyze and design systems by computer simulation using MATLAB or a similar software package.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes: After the course, students will be able to\\n1. Demonstrate understanding of the key concepts and mathematical representation models of signals and systems.\\n2. Strengthen their engineering skills involved in the design, analyze and simulation of systems process input signals in order to produce the desired outputs or to control the systems\u2019 behaviors.\\n3. Deepen their grasp of programming concepts and their programming skills.\\n4. Work effectively as a team to complete group assignments on practical signal processing applications.\\n5.

The course format will alternate between lecture and open-ended discussion.\\nThe course is structured in four major units as follows:\\nUnit 1: East Asian Order from 1600-1839\\nUnit 2: Crisis and Adaptation (1839-1895)\\nUnit 3: A New Balance of Power (1895-1945)\\nUnit 4: Rebuilding after World War II (1945-present)\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Students will develop knowledge, skills, and mindsets as follows:\\nKnowledge: Students will develop a broad understanding of the contours of modern East Asian history and a deep understanding of certain events and figures.\\nSkills: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources as well as between scholarly and non-scholarly sources, and they will develop an ability to critically evaluate texts by referring to other sources and by drawing on the knowledge they acquire in this course.\\nMindsets: Students will contemplate past ways of thinking about morality, politics, and religion in East Asia in order to make sense of the region\'s history. By extension, we will step outside of our usual ways of thinking about ethics, politics, and religion and develop a new appreciation for their historical contingency.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nLecture Quizzes: 10%\\nMapmaking assignment: 5%\\nDiscussion participation: 10%\\nUnit Reviews: 40%\\nMid-term Exam: 15%\\nFinal Exam: 20%","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"}],"location":"Art Studio"},{"title":"The Global Vietnam War II","id":"HIS209_Spring2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Sean Fear","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002X87Q7QAJ/his209spring2023s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Sean Fear\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisite: At least one 100-level course in History (HIS) or Vietnam Studies (VS)\\n* Cross-listed with Vietnamese Studies (VS)\\n---\\nCourse Description: From the Second World War to Vietnam\u2019s withdrawal from Cambodia in 1989, a series of multifaceted and interconnected conflicts gripped the Indochina peninsula. During this timespan, the wars in Vietnam evolved from anti-colonial struggle to superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As the struggle for Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states, citizens\u2019 movements, and other non-state actors whose interpretations and responses to the war were conditioned by a variety of competing local agendas. This course will assess critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese, origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers commit so much to a small, distant country? What role did the larger Cold War play in shaping overseas powers\u2019 decision-making? What was impact of each party\u2019s respective domestic politics? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? How did it shape the politics and economy of the region? And what are the global legacies of the war?\\nThe course will consider the Vietnam War as first and foremost a Vietnamese conflict, one which acquired increasingly global significance. In addition to exploring the domestic causes and dynamics of the Vietnam War, we will also consider the conflict - a seminal episode in the global Cold War - as a lens for analyzing a wide range of international events and trends. These include Empire and Decolonization; the Non-Aligned Movement; the Chinese Civil War; the American \u201cRed Scare\u201d; the Korean War; Development and Modernization Theory; the Sino-Soviet Split; China\u2019s Cultural Revolution; Detente; the rise of the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d; the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian Genocide; and the aftermaths, legacies, and interpretations of the conflict.\\nThis course is a continuation of HIS208 The Global War Part I, taught during the Autumn semester. However it is open to any students; previous enrollment in HIS208 The Global War Part I is not required\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: On completion of this module, students should be able to:\\n\u2022 To identify the principal causes of the Vietnam War\\n\u2022 To explore the factors prompting global powers to intervene, including the United States, France, the Soviet Union, South Korea, China, and Cambodia.\\n\u2022 To assess the global impact of the Vietnam War\\n\u2022 To engage with a range of theoretical and conceptual frameworks for understanding the war\\n\u2022 To evaluate important methodological and historiographical trends relating to the conflict\\n\u2022 Analyse a range of relevant primary and secondary sources.\\n\u2022 Apply the skills acquired in formulating nuanced and sophisticated arguments supported by historical evidence\\n\u2022 Apply transferable skills including effective written and oral communication, time management, and project management and completion, among others.\\n\u2022 Demonstrate critical thinking and analytical skill, and the ability to articulate complex ideas and interpretations verbally and in writing.\\n\u2022 Evaluate the interplay between domestic politics and foreign affairs in a wide range of global contexts.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek One: Choosing War: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam\\nReadings from: Lien-Hang Thi Nguyen, Pierre Asselin, Le Duan\\n\\nWeek Two: Choosing War: The United States\\nReadings from David Kaiser, Fredrik Logevall, Robert Dallek, Francis Bator, John Newman\\n\\nWeek Three: Choosing War: The National Liberation Front\\nReadings from David Elliott, David Hunt, Nguyen Thi Dinh, Truong Nhu Tang\\n\\nWeek Four: Modernisation and Development\\nReadings from Michael Latham, Simon Toner, Walt Whitman Rostow\\n\\nWeek Five: Counterinsurgency\\nReadings from Nguyen Cong Luan, Tran Ngoc Chau, Jonathan Schell, John Prados\\n\\nWeek Six: The Global Anti-War Movement\\nReadings from Tom Wells, Adam Garfinkle, Heonik Kwon\\n\\nWeek Seven: Vietnamese Women at War\\nReadings from: Sophie Quinn-Judge, Patricia Norland, An Nguyen\\n\\nWeek Eight: The Soviet Union\\nReadings from Mari Olson, Sergey Radchenko\\n\\nWeek Nine: China\\nReadings from Chen Jian, Qiang Zhai, Li Danhui, He Di\\n\\nWeek Ten: The Republic of Korea\\nReadings from Heonik Kwon, Tak Tae Yang, Hwang Suk-Yong\\n\\nWeek Eleven: Southeast Asia\\nReadings from Vincent Bevins, Richard Ruth, Thongchai Winichakul\\n\\nWeek Twelve: Vietnamisation\\nReadings from Jeffrey Kimball, Larry Berman, Johannes Kadura\\n\\nWeek Thirteen: The Second Republic\\nReadings from Sean Fear, Van Nguyen-Marshall, Hoang Duc Nha, Ly Quy Chung\\n\\nWeek Fourteen: Memories and Legacies\\nReadings from Will Nguyen, Bui Tin, Bui Diem\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nEssay: 30%\\nTake-home exam: 30%\\nFormative writing exercise: 20%\\nParticipation and attendance: 20%","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"16:45:00","end_time":"18:15:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"16:45:00","end_time":"18:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 & 9"},{"title":"History of Capitalism and the Corporation","id":"HIS210_Spring2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Elsa Costa","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002X87Q8QAJ/his210spring2023s01","description":"Faculty: Elsa Costa\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisites: 200-level course: sophomores and up unless dispensed with permission from teacher; one course in History, Economics, or Social Sciences unless dispensed by instructor.\\n* Cross-listed with Economics (ECON), Social Sciences (SS)\\n---\\nCourse Description: Where did capitalism come from?

Nonetheless, both the First Republic (1955-1963) and the Second Republic (1967-1975) had millions of supporters and were shaped by leaders and contributors who, whatever else, held sincere visions for what a constitutional, pluralistic Vietnam south of the Seventeenth Parallel might look like. This course provides a detailed assessment of the history of the Republic of Vietnam, beginning with its intellectual and political origins during the mid-colonial period through to its fraught manifestation and ultimate disintegration in the midst of a conflict that had evolved into a global Cold War struggle. In so doing we will examine the politics, economics, and culture of the Republic of Vietnam, addressing how and why the Republic came into being; the basis of Republican visions and ideology; and the nature and causes of the Republic\u2019s abrupt collapse from within in the fateful spring of 1975.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: On completion of this module, students should be able to:\\n\u2022 To engage with a range of theoretical and conceptual frameworks for understanding the history of the Republic of Vietnam\\n\u2022 To evaluate important methodological and historiographical trends relating to this time period.\\n\u2022 Analyse a range of relevant primary and secondary sources.\\n\u2022 Apply the skills acquired in formulating nuanced and sophisticated arguments supported by historical evidence.\\n\u2022 Apply transferable skills including effective written and oral communication, time management, and project management and completion, among others.\\n\u2022 Demonstrate critical thinking and analytical skill, and the ability to articulate complex ideas and interpretations verbally and in writing.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek One: Ideological Origins of Republicanism\\nReadings from Peter Zinoman, Christopher Goscha, Tuan Hoang, Agathe Larcher-Goscha\\n\\nWeek Two: The Colonial Bourgeoisie\\nReadings from Martina Nguyen, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Patricia Norland, Anthony Morreale\\n\\nWeek Three: Urban and Rural Vietnam\\nReadings from Hayden Cherry, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Gerard Sasges\\n\\nWeek Four: Print Media\\nReadings from Philippe Peycam, Shawn McHale, Hue-Tam Ho Tai\\n\\nWeek Five: The First Republic: Origins\\nReadings from Edward Miller, Jessica Chapman, Nguyen Phi-Van, Duy Lap Nguyen\\n\\nWeek Six: The First Republic: Development\\nReadings Edward Miller, Philip Catton, Geoff Stewart\\n\\nWeek Seven: Constitutionalism\\nReadings from Nu-Anh Tran, Edward Miller, Do Mau, Duong Thi Mai Elliott\\n\\nWeek Eight: Opposition and Protest\\nReadings from Edward Miller, Vu Van Mau, Arthur Dommen\\n\\nWeek Nine: A Turbulent Interregnum\\nReadings from Robert Topmiller, An Nguyen, Vo Long Trieu,\\n\\nWeek Ten: The Second Republic: Origins\\nReadings from Sean Fear, Jay Veith, Charles Joiner, Allan Goodman\\n\\nWeek Eleven: The Second Republic: Power and Protest\\nReadings from Sean Fear, An Nguyen, Nguyen Phi-Van, Tran Van Tuyen\\n\\nWeek Twelve: The Second Republic: Culture and Society\\nReadings from Olga Dror, Ngo Vinh Long, Jason Gibbs, John Schafer\\n\\nWeek Thirteen: The Second Republic: Collapse from Within?\\nReadings from Sean Fear, Dang Van Sung, Nguyen Be, Nha Ca\\n\\nWeek Fourteen: Aftermaths and Legacies\\nReadings from Nguyen Thien Y, Bui Diem, Cao Xuan Huy, Sam Vong\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nFormative Writing Assignment 20%\\nResearch Essay 30%\\nOnline exam 30%\\nAttendance and participation (including in-class exercises and presentations) 20%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"16:45:00","end_time":"18:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"16:45:00","end_time":"18:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 & 9"},{"title":"HIS Capstone II","id":"HIS402_Spring2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Offering Status","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002X92izQAB/his402spring2023s01","description":"This course is for the students who got Major Advisor\'s approval for the Capstone project in Year 4 at Fulbright. \\nPlease contact your Major Advisor to plan and complete your capstone.

Through texts, both fiction and non-fiction, we chart the emergence of the \u2018modern\u2019 fashion system and learn how fashion mediates our understanding of a literary text. By the 1860s, fashion had become an integral part of daily urban life, an expression of modernity itself in the words of French poet Charles Baudelaire. Why did, for instance, canonical writers like Charles Baudelaire and Colette also happen to work as fashion journalists?\\nIn what ways did the cultural mapping of fashion conducted by these writers from three distinct geographic areas diverge and converge? Why do so many modernist texts in the 20th century revolve around themes of dress? At once social, economic, political, and aesthetic in nature, fashion provides us with a unique lens through which to examine literature and culture. Key themes explored in the course include: rise of the modern city; gender and identity; class and capital; fashion and the environment. Some of the texts studied in the course include but are not limited to: \u201cSartor Resartus\u201d (Thomas Carlyle), \u201cPainter of Modern Life\u201d (Baudelaire), Ladies Paradise (Zola), Orlando (Virginia Woolf) and Banjo: A Story without a Plot (Claude McKay), among others.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After successful completion of the course, students will be able to:\\n1.

Probability and statistics is a mathematical theory that can help us understand about the randomness of events and use the data from the past to predict the future. In this course we will explore the nature of random events and build up the mathematical models and tools that can be used to calculate the chance of event happening. With a strong foundation we will also consider many real world problems on how to handle and understand data and make meaningful statistical inference. The applications come from many areas such as industrial quality control , market share prediction and even a little bit of Las Vegas gambling.

The course assumes that social psychology is more than a spectator sport by making links between theory, research and action. Guiding such work is the proposition that human beings have innate dignity and should be afforded equitable chances to flourish in life.\\n---\\nSyllabus\\nSession 01: Introduction to Applied Social Psychology\\nReadings:\\nHodgetts, D., Stolte, O., Sonn, C., Drew, N., Carr, S., & Nikora, L.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \\nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \\nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2VW_ACdTlNzySiySyfPfOrgxQztprrzGxxL_2pfo5Q/edit?usp=sharing \\nSummary \\nUnit One: Foundational Questions \u2013 This unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. The primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. Each week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d This unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \\n Unit Two: The Human Experience \u2013 This unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. Each week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis. Different iterations of the class can select form a list of topics depending upon the instructor\u2019s preference. These topics include: Food, Sex, Death, Wealth, Nations, Power, Religion, Language, Law, Morality, Race. Readings include Margaret Wilson\u2019s Indulgence, Sidney Mintz\u2019s Sweetness and Power, Renato Rosaldo\u2019s Grief and the Headhunter\u2019s Rage, Marshall Sahlins\u2019 The Original Affluent Societies, Erik Harms\u2019s The Boss, Ernest Gellner\u2019s Nationalism, Benedict Anderson\u2019s Imagined Communities, Alice Goffman\u2019s \u2018On the Run\u2019.

The course charts the evolution of ethnographic films from their initial concerns with representing the \u201cOther\u201d to their shifted attention to reflexivity and the politics of knowledge production across cultural boundaries. Throughout the course, we will be addressing various ethical, formal, and thematic concerns underlying contemporary thinking about ethnographic filmmaking. A variety of experimental ethnographic film and video makers will be introduced in weekly lectures and screenings. In the course of the semester, students will also be researching, assembling material, interviewing, and editing three short assignments and a final project that responds to the different thematical focuses. The formats utilized to produce these projects may include single-channel video, interactive video, or video installation. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nThis course aims to move beyond the fundamentals of ethnographic filmmaking toward the identification of this genre as an interdisciplinary art form, intricately intertwined with other disciplines of art and regimes of representation. As such, after successful completion of this course, students will be able to: \\n1. Comprehend foundational terminologies and techniques in ethnographic filmmaking.\\n2. Distinguish the major developments in the field of visual anthropology as related to the form of ethnographic film.\\n3. Interpret and apply social inquiries to cinematic language.\\n4. Describe and implement the elementary principles of ethnographic film production, including pre-production research (consent, interview guideline, and equipment preparation), production, and post-production.\\n5.

Why do we have sex? Moreover, how can we study sex anthropologically and ethically? Both in terms of male/female bodily sexes and in terms of sexual play and desire, sex has been a central concern to anthropologists since the very founding of the discipline in the late nineteenth century. This course analyzes the various aspects of sex from the perspective of two subfields of anthropology: sociocultural anthropology and linguistic anthropology. This includes but is not limited to: social and linguistic constructions of sex and gender; gendered violence; power and language; the regulation of sex; and the queering of sex. Course readings will draw broadly from both historical and contemporary work within sociocultural and linguistic anthropology, as well as critical works (theoretical and historical) in gender/sexuality studies.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of this course students should be able to:\\n1.

Why do nation states vary so substantially in their political freedoms and economic performances? What are similarities and differences that Vietnam bears from a comparative perspective? This course will seek to answer these big questions by developing an understanding of key concepts, theories and political system and policies of Vietnam. The course intertwines two major parts with Part I forming the foundation of the course by introducing the history, concepts, theories, and methodologies of Comparative Politics and the other exploring the actors and processes involved in the detailed case study, Vietnam. The course has a strong discussion-centered structure. Students are expected to read the assigned materials timely and thoughtfully and be ready to discuss the content in class.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Students should be able:\\nTo demonstrate a basic understanding of the relationships between individuals, actors, and processes across different political systems both historical and contemporary.\\nTo facilitate and/or cultivate a sense of critical awareness of the world beyond their own.\\nTo develop a stronger understanding of fundamental differences between different regime types, the relationship between politics and economic outcomes, the role of identity in politics.\\nTo apply the analytical and methodological tools of comparative politics to political outcomes they want to understand and explain.\\nTo use these tools to further examine the political system and policies of Vietnam. \\n---\\nCourse Readings:\\nThere is no textbook for this course.

It could as well be deeply latent inside the personal consciousness or at the hidden corner of the social collective mind. How will those quasi-transparent and subterranean features look like when they are visualized into such a grand expressive audio-visual art form as cinema? That is the first question for examination inside this course. By zooming into Vietnamese identities on contemporary Vietnamese big screen, the course is to carry out a thorough surgery on this matter of a \u201cnation in transition\u201d (William Lim, 2001) in the complex postmodern global context. This course focuses on the identity literacy for those who would like to take it seriously on Vietnam studies and particularly those who are interested in researching them through film aesthetics. First and foremost, it examines what identity is under theoretical viewpoint as well as its major attributed components as gender, race, class, and nation. In parallel, it re-examines what Vietnamese identities have been and what are the new layers of Vietnamese identities which are being reconstructed in the contemporary epoch.\\nAfter providing a brief knowledge on film aesthetics, the course will make use of those understandings to analyze and critique how contemporary Vietnamese filmmakers (of the 21st century) convey their personal as well as collective Vietnamese identities through each filmmaker\u2019s aesthetic choices. Those are not historical lessons on Vietnamese cinema since its birth but zooming into the contemporary Vietnamese film instead. More precisely, after the U.S opened the embargo with Vietnam, which opened a new chapter for the country in transition, the new epoch of Vietnamese cinema has also been opened, with a booming market and a radical of art-house and experimental genres having been emerged. For nearly thirty years, a new wave of contemporary filmmakers in Vietnam have been reinventing various aesthetic choices of the classic world cinema in order to shape a new face of Vietnamese cinema as well as Vietnamese collective identities. Hence, reading the embedded Vietnamese identities being embedded on Vietnamese big screen can\u2019t be distinguished from reading how Vietnamese cinema has been transformed aesthetically.\\nBy reading theories and defining specific cases on personal and collective identities on Vietnamese cinema inside its present socio-political context, this course aims to provide students a full and well-rounded understandings on the complex Vietnamese identities at the moment. Also, by the end of this course, students are expected to grasp a more well-rounded knowledge on cinema aesthetics and the way a film\u2019s visual and aural features are used to create essentially non-narrative dimensions of film, including the film\u2019s \u2018look\u2019.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students in this course will:\\n1. Evaluate Vietnamese identities and how contemporary Vietnamese films applying different aesthetics to convey its embedded identities.\\n2. Understand the distinctions between personal, collective and national identities and how they are conveyed as a part of film politics.\\n3. Explore Vietnamese complex socio-cultural materials for future courses of Vietnamese studies as well as film studies.\\n4.

Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Students will be exposed to \u201cVietnamese Studies\u201d currently practiced inside and outside Vietnam to realize which approaches have been employed in this interdisciplinary field, and how the field significantly varies in different geo-political, socio-cultural environments, depending on who is doing it and in which contexts it is carried out. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. Finally, students will have a chance to redefine \u201cVietnam Studies\u201d at Fulbright University Vietnam and figure out which directions it is heading towards. This course is open to VS majors and non-majors.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:\\n1.

In the practical knowledge section, we will be examining the current state of film production in Vietnam (from the beginning of the 21st century until the present day) by analyzing several popular production models: state funded films, films partially subsidized and commissioned by the government, privately investments, international co-productions, foreign films shooting and hiring crews in Vietnam and independent films seeking finance from domestic and international funds. This section also provides in-depth analysis and comparison regarding different systems of public policy directed towards the cinema industry in Vietnam and other countries such as Korea, China, France and America, apparent in their regulations, development strategies and various situations of censorship. Students will be able to grasp an understanding of how a country\'s public policy impacts the development of its cinema. \\n\\nThe screenwriting exercises, which take up to 75% of the class, will guide students through the process of coming up with ideas suitable to be developed in the context of aforementioned models of production as well as their capacities. Students will be trained to present these ideas in a professional format of a comprehensive look-book that is ready to pitch to potential production companies or investors. \\n\\nDepending on their progress, students are encouraged to develop ideas that challenge the audience\'s usual watching habits, the industry\'s current ability to produce as well as stereotypes about Vietnamese films and censorship in order for them to optimize their imagination and creativity. We hope the students can start contemplating on their own path to materialize the ideas that are \'impossible\' in the current context yet possible in the near future. \\n\\nThere will be two (tentative) guest speakers, Mrs. Dinh Thi Thanh Huong, Vice President of Galaxy Media & Entertainment and Director Charlie Nguyen, who will discuss with students on related topics.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to  \\nRECOGNIZE that historical and cultural heritage, as well as regional and global contexts, are all essential to understanding Vietnam;  \\nLISTEN, SPEAK, READ, and WRITE languages essential for understanding Vietnam, including but not limited to: classical/vernacular Chinese, N\xf4m script, and French at CEFR Level A2 or equivalent; \\nPERFORM close-readings and critical interpretations of texts and other media authored by local and international scholars, writers, and cultural producers;  \\nCOMMUNICATE and COLLABORATE effectively in intercultural environments;  \\nFORMULATE and CONDUCT substantial independent research projects;  \\nAPPLY interdisciplinary skills and methods to address contemporary issues and become active citizens in Vietnamese society. \\n---\\nSyllabus\\nSECTION 1 \\nSession 1: Overview of film production in Vietnam from the beginning of 21st century to the present day (Lesson 1): The rapid change of the global film market perceived through the tendency of the audience, the way movies are produced and consumed, the dominance of major cinemas and their impacts on Vietnamese cinema \\n+ What has Vietnamese cinema done to survive in this fiercely competitive and rapidly changing landscape? \\nThe government\'s unsuccessful attempts to regain the dominance through state-funded productions: why did state-funded movies fail and why has this string of failures persisted to this day with no resolution?

Most notable are computer vision and natural language processing. Those accomplishments are thanks to its solid foundations in statistics, computer science and mathematics. The next frontier for ML is business and/or finance where ML\u2019s applications are in an early stage. Successful ML integrations into business domain require a rigorous understanding of the foundations of ML so that appropriate models can be adapted to real-world applications with a careful consideration of costs and risks involved. This statistical learning course takes you on a journey from classical statistics to statistical learning theory. You will start with basic ideas originated from statistics, understand the strengths and weaknesses of classical models and develop the learning algorithms addressing those weaknesses. The course will build you a strong background to move on to the next stage in ML with more advanced courses or to create real-world applications.  \\n ---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nPresent fundamental statistical learning concepts visually and analytically.\\nUtilize statistical learning models to solve classical problems like regression and classification.\\nImplement statistical learning algorithms with Python and/or R programming languages.\\nApply statistical and programming skills to real-world problems.\\n---\\nTextbook and References\\nGareth James et. al.

We first discuss the history of ideas in anthropological theory surrounding ideas of power and social change: early functionalist approaches presumed static traditions, whereas Marxist, feminist and postcolonial intellectual movements invited anthropologists to theorize structure and agency, power and contradiction, dialectics and change. Common-sense notions of \u201csocial movement\u201d still pose a conceptual challenge to anthropology and ethnography as a method: What distinguishes a social movement from social change broadly put? An anthropological approach to politics means that the modern western delimitation of the \u201cpolitical\u201d must itself be viewed as a historical development, and one with gendered, classed and racialized dimensions. How do we locate a social movement ethnographically? What does ethnography as method teach us about social movements that we might not otherwise see? How do we proceed ethically, attending to questions of positionality, subjectivity, objectivity?  \\nThese conceptual discussions are presented in relation to ethnographic studies in Latin America, East Asia, North America and Eastern Europe, wherein students are also introduced to general disciplinary debates such as the challenges of multisited ethnography, cultural relativism, conceptualizing relations between the \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cglobal\u201d, digital ethnography, fieldwork methods and ethics, and practices of public anthropology, including writing to and for participants in social movements. The case studies are explored to emphasize the particular benefit of approaching \u201csocial movements\u201d with an anthropological lens onto everyday life; in the process, social theoretical concepts such as Marxism, anarchism, feminism and intersectionality are themselves productively decentered as cultural and historical objects.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nFrame research and questions within the context of the field\u2019s historic foundations  \\nApply and explain texts and concepts in social science theory. \\nAnalyze social science theory related to \'social movements\' as a history of ideas\\nUnderstand the disciplinary methodology of ethnography in relation to the topic.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nJune 14\\nIntroduction to Class\\nMODULE I : Social Movements in Theory\\nJune 21\\nPART I: Social Movements in Anthropological Perspective: What is Politics?  \\nNelson, Lise. 2003. \\"Decentering the Movement: Collective Action, Place, and the \'Sedimentation\' of Radical Political Discourses.\\" Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 21:559-581.\\nLagalisse, Erica. 2013. \\"Gossip as Direct Action.\\" In Contesting Publics: Feminism, Activism, Ethnography, edited by Sally and Lynne Phillips Cole.

They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\\n---\\nSample Topic Schedule\\n\\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\\n1.

Photography is present in a wide range of practices from avant-garde arts to mass media, from the convention of photo identification to the techniques of surveillance, from photojournalism to selfies and Instagram. Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded. With special attention to the intersection of photography and Vietnamese history, the course will also demonstrate how constellations of power - with regards to class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economy, and geopolitics - influence the practice, dissemination, and preservation of photography in Vietnam today.\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe course is designed to encourage students to: \\nAcquire a solid foundation on key theoreticians and artists who have engaged with the medium of photography. \\nAdopt an integrated range of flexible, research-led approaches to the studies of photographic history and theories. \\nStrengthen key skills in writing, reading, and public engagement necessary for higher-level courses in the Art and Media Studies major as well as related fields.","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 (BW)"},{"title":"Introduction to Video and Film Production","id":"ARTS104_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Trinh Dinh Le Minh","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdwfQAA/arts104fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Trinh Dinh Le Minh - Email: minh.trinh@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nPre-requisite: No\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThis video and film production course will introduce students to the basic elements of recording and combining image and sound using various kinds of digital equipment.

We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage.

What does it mean to make theater today? What can we learn from a form of performance that has continuously strived to establish itself as a form of art throughout history? This course introduces Theater as a Practice: it provides an overview of the developmental history of theater while introducing students to its experimental forms. It encourages learning by juxtaposing conventional/historical ways of making theatrical works to contemporary interdisciplinary approaches, which engage visual art, philosophy, psychology, architecture, and new media, to ultimately create new collective experiences. Students will learn the essentials of a theater work, and will be able to apply what they have learned by creating a work of their own. As a crucial component of collaborative learning, students will learn to give informed and respectful feedback to a work-in-progress, the building block of experimental theater.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After the course, students will be able to:\\nObserve, identify, and analyze the key component(s) of a theater work.\\nConduct research on theater/performance and clearly communicate their findings.\\nUnderstand and evaluate interdisciplinary approaches to theater-making.\\nStage a short performative theatrical piece.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nThe below content can be spread out between 10 and 14 weeks so that students have sufficient time for practice, critique, and production.

Instead of taking the form of a country survey, the course is thematically structured, with topics informed by artistic practices and concerns. As such, the course emphasizes close analysis of selected case studies and the works of artists who are considered among the most historically significant from the Asian region and its diasporas. This approach helps us understand contemporary art practice as intellectually conditioned, transnationally networked, and as something embedded in both local and global economic, cultural, and political developments. In addition, close examination of artworks will enable students to gain a deeper understanding of how these artists have navigated and continue to navigate the specificities of local histories, sensorial encounters with changing materials, technologies, and spaces, and the complexities of identity and belonging.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:\\nIdentify important contemporary artists in Asia and its diasporas, and situate their practices within national and transnational historical, cultural, and political contexts.\\nDemonstrate advanced skills in visual and textual literacy, demonstrable through analysis of sophisticated artworks and challenging texts in contemporary art criticism and scholarship.\\nEmploy relevant theoretical methods for interpreting contemporary artworks.\\nAcquire competency in scholarly research, effective oral presentation, and academic and curatorial writing required for continued graduate study and career pathways in industry professions.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nProvisional topics:\\n\xb7 \u201cContemporary Asian Art\u201d: Mapping the Field\\n\xb7 Video Art and Cybernetics\\n\xb7 Women Performance Artists from Japan\\n\xb7 Conceptualism in Southeast Asia: The Artist-Curator\\n\xb7 Pop and Politics in Late Socialist China\\n\xb7 Contemporary \u201cBuddhist\u201d Art?\\n\xb7 Relational Art and Social Engagement\\n\xb7 The Artist and the State in Singapore\\n\xb7 Art, Activism, and Islam in Indonesia\\n\xb7 Feminist Cyborgs / Posthuman Bodies\\n\xb7 Spectacle, Surveillance, and Art Superstars in China\\n\xb7 The Rise of \u201cContemporary Asian Art\u201d\\n\xb7 One Artist Talk\\n\xb7 One Field Trip\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading\\nWeekly Discussion Questions 10%\\nParticipation 10%\\nPresentation: Artwork Case Study 20%\\nBook Review 25% (1000-1250 words)\\nExhibition Proposal 30% (2000-2500 words)","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"12:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 2"},{"title":"Animation and Graphic Media in East Asia","id":"ARTS307_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Linda Zhang","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdwlQAA/arts307fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Dr. Linda C.

But how does animation \u201cpervade\u201d through different cultural, political, and economic contexts, even affecting expression, medium, and even technologies associated with animated forms? This course is structured by the idea of animation \u201cpervading\u201d throughout East Asia historically and also theoretically. To begin, we will start with theoretical discussions about the potential in the motion and form of animation. Simultaneously, we will discuss other forms of graphic media to question what pictures reveal about themselves, in terms of materiality, visuality, and language. During the semester, we will focus on different case studies of popular mass media and print cultures in the early 20th centuries in East Asia, such as wartime and postwar cel animation films, as well as adaptations of manga, manhua, and manhwa into print form, film, television, video games, and even fan culture. This course is also concerned with how serialization, translation, and adaptation affect the relationship between \u201coriginal\u201d and \u201ccopy.\u201d To study these questions, students will be asked to conduct a research presentation on East Asian comics and animation, write a critical review of one form of serialized animation or graphic media, and to write and design a final project exploring the theories and forms of moving-image and print culture that we have discussed during the semester.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nDemonstrate familiarity with animation directors, graphic writers and artists from China, Japan, and Korea\\nAnalyze films and literary texts, annotate with proficiency in filmic (visual, audio) and literary formal techniques; engaging with the field theorists in animation, literature, and graphic media\\nWrite, construct, and present reviews, rationales, and essays into a clear, original, and persuasive interpretive claims, in both oral and written formats\\nConduct and present interdisciplinary research across the arts, media, and literary disciplines\\nDesign graphic media and animation project synthesizing theoretical readings and case study research from the course\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1 (August 28-31) Introductions to the course \u2013 Pictures and the Animated Form\\nReadings:\\n- Eisenstein, Sergei.

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives\\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\\n---\\nCourse Materials:\\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas.

We discuss the topics of inflation and unemployment, and their relationship using the Phillips curve. We then focus on the interaction between capital accumulation and the aggregate production function and analyze the effects of the saving rate on the level and the growth rate of output.

This course addresses how technology has changed the modes of communication through which firms engage with consumers. It provides a curated overview of very recent cases and theories related to Big Consumer Data, fine-grained behavioral analytics, new monitoring tools, precise and personalized customer relationship management practices, mobile-first strategies and location-based messaging, content management, social media and its networked based predictive modeling, new forms of targeting and referral strategies, and user generated content. The course uses a Learning-by-Doing pedagogy by having students work with company teams on real-life digital marketing challenges in the 2nd half of the course. The lectures, cases and action-learning are all to understand and practice how to strategize digital marketing.\\n---\\nCourse learning outcomes: By the time students complete this course they should be able to:\\n1. Basic proficiency in various areas in digital marketing, such as UX, web analytics, search, social media, search, personalization, and customer journeys.\\n2. Understand the changing landscape of Marketing Tech\\n3. Comprehend and apply the range of digital marketing tools to analyze, recommend, devise and evaluate firm strategies aimed at improving the digital performance\\n4. Apply and execute insights-based digital marketing campaigns\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\nThis course follows the pedagogy of Learning-by-Doing by experimenting with different tactics in Digital Marketing strategies. But before we do, we as a class will discuss and apply marketing strategic thinking in order to consistently translate the strategy into: (1) User Experience / Website, (2) SEO, (3) Organic Search, (4) Paid Search, (5) Paid Social, and (6) Email / Campaign Management.\\nThe course consists of two phases. In the first phase, our focus is on concept learning; the second phase will be on application of the concepts strategy formulation. Ideally in the week before the Mid-term, in the week of March 20-24. The final presentations in which the students and companies present their learning and impact can take place in the 14th / 15th/ 16th week of the Spring semester\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nCLASS PARTICIPATION \u2013 10% (Individual)\\nTHOUGHT LEADERSHIP ESSAY \u2013 total 30% (Individual)\\nINDIVIDUAL TOOL LEARNING ASSIGNMENT \u2013 1-hour assignment 20% (Individual) Google Analytics UX: UserTesting.com SEO: MOZ Academy Social Listening: Hootsuite\\nEXPERIMENTATION/HACKING \u2013 Final Paper with a pre-campaign briefing: 40% (Team)","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"17:00:00","end_time":"20:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"17:00:00","end_time":"20:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 (BW)"},{"title":"Econometrics","id":"ECON209_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Ngoc Phan","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdxLQAQ/econ209fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Phan Tuan Ngoc - E: ngoc.phan@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2), Mathematics and Computing (E4)\\nPre-requisite: MATH105 Introduction to Statistics (Introduction to Data Analysis) OR ECON 102 Economic Methods\\nCross-listed with Applied Mathematics (MATH) major.\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course introduces students to the fundamental intuitions of causal inference and the associated econometrics toolkit.

Answer: They all use auctions. Auctions are pervasive in our everyday lives. An auction does not necessarily consist of raising your hand to place a bid (or clicking on a button on eBay). There are many different types of auctions: descending auctions, second price auctions, reverse auctions, simultaneous ascending auctions, combinatorial auctions are just a few examples. Each auction format is adapted to a specific situation, and understanding what the key differences between various auction formats are and under which circumstances one should use a specific auction format will be one of the main purposes of this course. The starting point will consist of a reflection on what a market is and show that the very specific details about how demand and supply \u201cmeet\u201d can have a profound impact. The first half of the course will present the main auction formats and discuss their differences. The second half will focus on market mechanisms where there is no price, such medical resident match or school assignments.

For example, they are the heart of a wide range of applications, from healthcare, smart homes and cities, transportation, and manufacturing. For example, a real-time embedded system that we use daily is smartphones, which feature multiple sensors like accelerometer, proximity, gyroscope, GPS position, and fingerprint. The systems must react to events in the external, often analog, environment within a predefined time limit and subject to hardware constraints, such as memory, computational capability, and power consumption. This imposes several challenges in acquiring and processing raw data from sensors to derive meaningful information and making suitable decisions to control the environment using actuators. This course introduces students with the fundamentals of designing, implementing, and analyzing real-time digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms in embedded systems, including required theory on key DSP concepts, the hardware used to sample and process the signals, and software development environments. In the first half of the course, structured laboratory assignments familiarize students with the hardware and software. In each lab, students will implement and evaluate multiple DSP algorithms for a given application such as sampling and digital filtering. Each algorithm can achieve a certain signal quality but a certain implementation cost, e.g., run-time complexity, which measures how fast the algorithm executes or runs on the input data to produce output data. As a critical thinking exercise, students will explore design tradeoffs in signal quality vs. run-time complexity. In the second half of the course, student groups will work on extensive real-time DSP projects of their choice to develop system-level design skills in a complex, unstructured problem context. Smartphones and STM32 high-performance microcontrollers would be the target real-time embedded systems for the labs and project.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will:\\n- Acquire an appreciation of the importance of real-time DSP for a broad class of real-world engineering applications;\\n- Learn and explain key concepts, ideas, and methods in a signal processing application area;\\n- Use multiple technical information resources, including library resources such as the research literature, the World Wide Web, and consultation with experts, to independently learn about advanced topics and to overcome technical obstacles;\\n- Identify and use a modern embedded DSP hardware system and development environment to develop, debug, refine, defend, implement, and test real-time digital signal processing algorithms for practical applications;\\n- Recognize, appreciate, and evaluate the tradeoffs necessary in algorithm design for real-time DSP implementation in embedded systems;\\n- Work jointly with peers in developing, debugging, and testing code and in completing laboratory assignments and term-projects;\\n- Complete and demonstrate a successful implementation of a digital signal processing design project in an embedded system; and\\n- Document a signal processing design project, including the engineering principles, procedure, implementation, and testing;\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek\\nDates\\nLecture\\nContent outline\\nLab assignments\\n1\\nAug. 28 - Sep. 03\\n1\\n- Course introduction\\n- Ground rule co-design\\n- Hardware and software introduction\\nLab #1: Overview of hardware and software tools\\n2\\nHardware implementation of sinusoidal generation algorithms\\n2\\nSep. 04 - Sep. 10\\n3\\nLab #2: Smartphone-based data acquisition processing\\n4\\n3\\nSep. 11 - Sep. 17\\n5\\nSignals and systems review and extension\\nLab #3: Sine wave generation\\n6\\n4\\nSep. 18 - Sep. 24\\n7\\n8\\nDigital filter design and hardware implementation: Overview\\n5\\nSep. 25 - Oct. 01\\n9\\nDigital filter design and hardware implementation: Finite Impulse Response (FIR)\\nLab #4: IMU pedometer\\n10\\n6\\nOct. 02 - Oct. 08\\n11\\nLab #5: Digital filters\\n12\\nDigital filter design and hardware implementation: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)\\n7\\nOct. 09 - Oct. 15\\n13\\n14\\n8\\nOct. 16 - Oct. 22\\n15\\nSampling and aliasing review and hardware implementation\\nLab #6: Data scrambler\\n16\\n9\\nOct. 23 - Oct. 29\\n-\\nMidterm break - no lectures\\nNo lab sections\\n10\\nOct. 30 - Nov. 05\\n17\\nMid-term exam\\nTerm-project proposal development and submission\\n18\\nAmplitude quantization\\n11\\nNov. 06 - Nov. 12\\n19\\nShort-time spectral analysis\\nLab #7: Spectrogram\\n20\\nCorrelation analysis\\n12\\nNov. 13 - Nov. 19\\n21\\nAudio DSP: Overview\\nLab #8: Guitar special effects\\n22\\nAudio DSP: Pitch modification\\n13\\nNov. 20 - Nov. 26\\n23\\nAudio DSP: Acoustic localization\\n-   Lab #9: Pitch detection\\n-   Project proposed design review\\n24\\n14\\nNov. 27 - Dec. 03\\n25\\nSpecial topics: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\\nLab #10: Pitch synthesis\\n26\\n15\\nDec. 04 - Dec. 10\\n27\\nSpecial topics: Image processing\\nTerm-project development and finalization\\n28\\nSpecial topics: Video Kalman filter\\n16\\nDec. 11 - Dec. 17\\n-\\nBack-up for lecture (if needed)\\n-\\nFinal Term-project presentation\\n17\\nDec. 18 - Dec. 24\\n-\\nBack-up for lecture or presentation (if needed)\\n\\nTextbooks:\\nR.

Despite its fundamental role in world history, it has received little attention until the 19th century, when the region came under Western rule and/or influence. Southeast Asia is a vast and complex region comprised of eleven independent states: Brunei, Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. It has one of the world\'s greatest ethnic, linguistic, religious, and cultural diversity. Throughout the semester, students will explore: Indianization, Sinicization; state formation and development; trade and circulation of ideas; Islamization, and Christianization; Asian colonialisms; Western colonialism and its legacies; nation-building; decolonization and birth of Southeast Asian nations; postcolonial regimes, \u201cAsian values\u201d, and \u201cdemocracy\u201d; politicization of the religions and radicalization; minority struggles, separatism, and autonomy. Finally, to get a more nuanced approach of the events, students will have the opportunity be introduced to vernacular sources and Southeast Asian perspectives on events that affected their societies and historical developments but had also a deep impact on the formation of Southeast Asia as we know it today.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:\\nWith a foundational grounding in history and theory, students will comprehend the broader processes of empire, political communities, transnationalism, interethnic association, politicized religions and competition.\\nStudents will apply these lessons to study other contexts in Vietnam, Southeast Asia, and the world.\\nThrough readings, discussions, and debates, students will learn to critically analyze primary and secondary sources, to address fundamental questions of historical change, and develop evidence-based argumentation.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nSelected readings:\\nCase, W. 2002.

Often that history is hotly contested. This gateway course introduces students to the dynamic field of history and explores not only how we study the past, but how historical narratives are created, used, and abused in the present. Every year students will explore a special theme as way to probe the origins of the profession, develop historical literacy, and challenge their assumptions about objectivity. They will also acquire the skills necessary to read and analyze primary and secondary sources, investigate complex and often sensitive historical questions, and critically evaluate arguments about past events presented in traditional print media, online spaces, and the public. This year Exploring the Past will investigate \u201cGlobal Saigon.\u201d By examining a diverse array of topics from food and architecture to religion and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, students will study the connections the world has made to Saigon and Saigon has made to the world. In so doing, students will better understand how to analyze the often controversial historical narratives that surround colonialism, capitalism, communism, and migration, as well as how Vietnam\u2019s past gets written\u2014and by whom.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nIntroduction: What is History?\\nThe Landscape of History and Thematic Module I [Locating Global Saigon]\\nHow to Read Like a Historian, Part I: Developing Historical Literacy\\nCan History Be Objective?\\nThematic Module II [Nam Ti\u1ebfn(s): Past and Present] (Media Review Due)\\nHow to Read Like a Historian, Part II: Primary and Secondary Sources\\nThematic Module III [Relgion: Temples, Mosques, and Cathedrals] and Thinking Historically Practicum\\nThe Uses and Abuses of History, Part I\\nThematic Module IV [Food: Colonial Diets and Anxiety]\\nThe Uses and Abuses of History, Part II\\nThematic Module V [Music: Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll in Southern Vietnam] (Object Histories Due)\\nObject History Presentations and Thematic Module VI [Saigon Overseas]\\nWho Owns the Past?

From outcasts and outlaws to religious fanatics, failed revolutionaries, ethnic minorities, \u201ccollaborators,\u201d and distant subjects from the far reaches of the French empire, students will interrogate the dynamics of colonialism by studying those who both resisted and assisted imperial rule \u201cfrom below.\u201d While rooted in history, this course will draw on research and conceptual tools from adjacent fields, including anthropology, gender studies, literature, and political science to ask what\u2014and who\u2014is revealed and obscured in the archives, works of literature, and official accounts used to study colonial Indochina. By focusing on the experiences of colonization rather than the institutional histories from which many are excluded, students will hone their social history skills and better understand how the past marginalization of people who ended up \u201closing side\u201d of history continues to affect social relations in contemporary Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. At the end of the course, students will research, curate, and present a digital archive project that highlights an individual or group from the colonial period who remain overlooked in contemporary histories of the region.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will:\\nUnderstand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos during the French colonial period.\\nAcquire and apply the methodologies of social history.\\nCompare and contrast how various historical phenomenon and ideologies (e.g. nationalism, colonialism, capitalism, communism) affected different social classes in colonial-era Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and trace how the legacies of these histories affect social relations in the present.\\nCritically analyze and evaluate primary and secondary sources to locate marginalized historical actors and address fundamental questions of historical social change in French Indochina.\\nCraft evidence-based argumentation through research and written assignments aimed at both academic and public audiences.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\n1.

Everything around us, our own bodies, all the things that we interact with, are a collection of chemicals. The study of chemistry thus allows us to explore and understand the matters and processes associated with nature and human life. General Chemistry is a gateway to this fascinating physical world, it offers the fundamental understanding of structures and properties of matters, from subatomic particles to macroscopic substances. It explains the rules of chemistry and physics that govern matters\u2019 behavior and interaction. What is the universe made of? Why do nuclear reactions both demand and release so much energy? Why do certain substances melt or boil at high or low temperatures? What makes a reaction go slower or faster and why do we even care? What is pH and how can our blood maintain stable pH? These are just a few of the questions we can answer in this course. As an essential course in most science education programs, General Chemistry serves as foundation for other courses in Chemistry, Biology, Materials Science, Environmental Sciences\u2026 For non-science major students, this course provides basic scientific understanding of our physical world.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of the course students will be able to:\\nExplain the structure of atoms, molecules, and their properties.\\nClassify chemical reactions based on changes in reactants and energy.\\nInterpret the three laws of thermodynamics in closed systems and in chemical reactions.\\nSolve chemical equilibrium problems, particularly related to pH and solubility.\\nDescribe simple reaction mechanisms and define rate equations.\\nAnalyze real world problems related to general chemistry through written communication.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nIn favor of opensource resources for learning, this course will use 2 online textbooks: \\n\u201cChemistry\u201d by Openstax College, available here: https://web.ung.edu/media/Chemistry2/Chemistry-LR.pdf \\n\u201cGeneral Chemistry: An atoms first approach\u201d by Josh Halpern, available here: https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Book%3A_General_Chemistry_-_An_Atoms_First_Approach_(Halpern)\\nWeek 1 - 5: Structure and bonding\\nWeek 6- 10: Thermodynamics and chemical reactions T\\nWeek 11- 14: Equilibrium\\nWeek 15 -16: Kinetics\\nFinal exam\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading\\nAttendance: 10%\\nSurveys: 5%, \\nOnline quizzes: 40%. \\nExams: 35%\\nWriting assignment: 10%.","categories":["E3"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"11:30:00","end_time":"13:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"11:30:00","end_time":"13:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 (BW)"},{"title":"Organismal Diversity and Evolution","id":"IS211_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Jesse Hollister","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdxaQAA/is211fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Jesse Hollister - E: jesse.hollister@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Sciences and Engineering (E3)\\nPre-requisite: CORE 104 Scientific Inquiry AND IS 101 Introductory Biology\\nShopping time: First two weeks, in-person\\n---\\nCourse Description: \\nAn introduction to the diversity of organisms on planet Earth, and the processes that generate and maintain their diversity.

Students will learn about the diversity and evolution of microorganisms, different kinds of communication, signaling, and interactions between microorganisms, as well as the feedback loops between microorganisms and the environments. For example: students will be able to answer the question why some microbes only exist in extreme environmental conditions, or why some microbes rely on other microbes or the host to proliferate, or whether we can use microorganisms as a forensic indicator or use microbial genetic materials as biomarkers to study environmental health. Students will explore the role of microorganisms in soil formation, water quality, food production, plant health, biogeochemical cycling as well as in human civilization, including medicine, industry, biotechnology, bioremediation, or even the exploration of the outer space. Furthermore, this course also emphasizes on a variety of hands-on traditional (i.e., culturing) and advanced laboratory techniques (i.e., molecular technique) to study microorganisms. The laboratory component of the course will also introduce students to some applications of microorganisms in daily life and in solving the world problems. Overall, the course will provide fundamental knowledge of environmental microbiology and guide the students to leverage this understanding to find creative solutions related to current environmental issues that threaten planetary and human health (i.e.: antibiotic resistance, pollution, and global warming).\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of the course, students will be able to:\\nDescribe the functional roles of microbial communities in diverse ecosystems;\\nCompare and evaluate microbial communities based on their DNA sequences;\\nPredict changes in microbial community structure according to changes in biotic and abiotic factors;\\nUnderstand how plants, soil, and human microbiomes are interconnected and how they can influence each other;\\nIntegrate their knowledge in environmental microbiology and ecosystems management to find out solutions for environmental issues.\\nPerform a wide variety of traditional and advanced laboratory techniques to study microorganisms and to apply microorganisms to solve the world socioeconomic and environmental problems\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus: To be updated and shared by the course instructor.\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading; Total 1,000 pts\\nAttendance 50 pts\\nReading Quiz 200 pts\\nLab Journal 200 pts\\nGroup Presentation 150 pts\\nMidterm Exam 200 pts\\nFinal Exam 200 pts","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Lab"},{"title":"Human Physiology","id":"IS306_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Nguyen Thi Hong Dung","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdxdQAA/is306fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Nguyen Thi Hong Dung - E: hongdung.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\\nPre-requisite: IS 101 Introductory Biology AND IS 212 Cell Biology\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nHuman Physiology is the study and science of human function with a \\"micro-to-macro\\" approach at the organization\'s cell, organ, tissue, and body system levels. In other words, physiology provides us with the understanding to answer questions such as who we are, how we live, and, eventually, how we die. In addition, the insights into physiology give future scientists in health and biology a powerful tool for understanding how and why disease processes present clinically in the way that they do. Human physiology follows the structure and the roles of each organ system in the human body. Topic coverage includes basic cell physiology, homeostasis, and physiology of the integumentary, nervous, skeletal, muscular, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrine, and respiratory systems. Nutrition and exercise physiology are also introduced to promote body awareness that leads to the optimal choices for maintaining good health for a lifetime.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nexplain the molecular and cellular mechanisms in normal physiological processes of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems in humans, and understand the basic mechanisms of homeostasis across these levels\\ndescribe the basic structure and function of the skeletal, muscular, integumentary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrine, nervous, and respiratory systems\\napply functional mechanisms and their regulation to explain pathophysiological conditions\\neffectively generate hypotheses about physiological processes related to normal and pathological conditions and design experiments to test hypotheses\\nanalyze the nutrient content of your personal diet relative to national guidelines and make recommendations for self-improvement\\ndemonstrate analytical skills in developing and answering research questions within the broader field of biological research through experimentation, literature review, and communication.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nTextbooks: Lippincott\xaeIllustrated Reviews: Physiology, Robin R.

Humans have always been fascinated (and disturbed) by things at the borders of \u201cpolite\u201d society. Spooky, ominous, and dark themes have endured across time, even gaining momentum in the last ten years with television like The Haunting at Hill House, novels like Mylene Dressler\u2019s The Last to See Us, or video games like the Devil May Cry series. This course will ask: why are we so fascinated by things that are spooky or supernatural? In what way is fear or dread a meaningful literary theme? And how has the gothic genre evolved to speak to us across different times and cultures? In this class, students will learn how to analyze literature, read critically, make claims about how texts work, and identify major themes and approaches. Students will also explore how texts work differently depending on their genre and form. Finally, the course will prompt students to question how literature articulates the values of the culture that produced it and to make connections between course materials and the world that surrounds them. Texts may include short stories by Angela Carter, Boleslaw Prus, and Edgar Allen Poe, novels by Henry James or Emily Bronte, and film or television by Jordan Peele and Guillermo del Toro.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\n1. Obtain a working knowledge of terms and approaches related to gothic literature, studies of fear and horror (e.g. grotesque, uncanny, abject, monstrosity, cultural studies, etc.) and how to apply them\\n2. Find balance between identifying the way that horror or fear in specific texts works to illuminate distinct cultural values and making comparative connections between texts produced in different cultures\\n3. Understand and apply close reading skills, with particular emphasis on connecting close reading to thematic analysis\\n4. Strengthen understanding of the formal elements of literature, with a particular emphasis on the techniques and structure of different genres\\n5. Strengthen argumentation and ability to provide evidence for claims both verbally and in writing\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nVarious short pieces early in the semester to teach genre, form, and close analysis, as outlined below:\\nUnit 1: The gothic, the grotesque, the uncanny, and the abject (4 weeks)\\nUnit 2: Holding the monster at bay\u2014hauntings, horrors, and the invading other (4 weeks)\\nUnit 3: The beast within: the depravity of the human soul (4 weeks)\\nUnit 4: Film analysis\u2014fear, horror, and monstrosity in specific cultural contexts (2-3 weeks)\\n---\\nPossible Assessments and Grading:\\n10% Reading Quizzes: assessed at random of the course of the semester, measures minimum reading comprehension and upkeep with work\\n20% Participation\\n10% Scribe Assignment: assigned at random over the course of the semester, students will be responsible for notetaking and distilling the information from class and reading discussion into a document form that can be used as study materials, defines key terms, and highlights major issues\\n20% Explication Essay(2x10%): close reading focused, asks students to engage deeply and create an argument about a short excerpt of 40 lines or less\\n15% Create-Your-Own-Monster & Reflection: creative project where students select a culture and design a unique monster that responds to specific cultural fears, values, etc. Students are encouraged to explore their own home culture.

Second, how do those representations differ across cultures and geographies? What does that tell us about human relationships to the world around us, as well as how heterogenous those relationships can be? This course will feature materials from what we might know today as \u201cthe global south\u201d (though not exclusively) to initiate conversations about how power, oppression, and consumption affect those earlier mentioned relationships and representations. We will not only learn to shift awareness to environmental concerns in literature but also learn theories and approaches to facilitate that shift. Broadly speaking this course introduces students to the methodology of ecocriticism, or the study of ecoliterature, but also to intersectionality, where race, class, gender, and place can affect one another and manifest in literature.

In addition, we will spend one-third of the semester studying the literature of the Harlem Renaissance. We will situate modern American literature within its specific socio-historical, cultural, and philosophical contexts. The selected readings focus on (1) how the Great Depression had a significant impact on American writers, (2) the problem of race in literature of the Harlem Renaissance, (3) women writers and their imaginative explorations of gender politics, (4) the gap between the hopefulness of the Reconstruction era and the traditionalism of what became known as the Southern renaissance, (5) how modern authors critique American provincial life, and (6) poetry and the search for form. Besides the selected short stories, poetry, and drama, you will read three novels: Langston Hughes\'s Not Without Laughter, Hemingway\'s The Sun Also Rises, and Edith Wharton\'s Ethan Frome.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After completing this course, students will be able to:\\nunderstand the historical, cultural, critical, and especially literary contexts of modern American literature, particularly during the interwar years 1914-1945\\nunderstand the major characteristics of American literary modernism and will be able to utilize those characteristics to analyze individual works of American literature in both literary and artistic forms.\\nengage thoughtfully and openly with a range of critical and theoretical perspectives on literary and cultural (and even controversial) issues, including the ability to state clearly the assumptions and premises of their own positions.\\nperform a literary close reading (both in class discussions, exercises, and assignments and in out-of-class writing assignments), demonstrating an ability to read and interpret literary works by thoughtfully integrating quoted passages into larger argumentative claims\\nwrite clear, grammatically correct, and rhetorically effective papers of literary analysis and interpretation (and perhaps even of critique), driven by a thesis and sustained by logic, textual and historical evidence, and a reasoned, ordered, and coherent argument.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nRequired textbooks:\\n1/ The Norton Anthology of American Literature, 1914-1945 (9th edition)\\n2/ Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises\\n3/ Langston Hughes, Not Without Laughter\\n4/ Edith Wharton, Ethan Frome\\nReading schedule:\\nWEEK 1:\\nSession 1: Syllabus & Introduction\\nSession 2: Edwin A.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \\nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \\nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\n\\nUnit One: Foundational Questions\\nThis unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. \\nThe primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. \\nEach week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d\\nThis unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \\n Unit Two: The Human Experience\\nThis unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. \\nEach week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis. \\nDifferent iterations of the class can select form a list of topics depending upon the instructor\u2019s preference.

We are spending more time and effort in borderless cyberspace but at the same time, dealing with issues in the multicultural physical space. Technology and society co-evolve, thus making it essential to understand both in order to grasp the best opportunities and also prepare for the upcoming challenges that arise from the ever increasing integration of technologies into our societies. While a discussion takes place among experts and in academia, foremost in the domain of Science and Technology Studies (STS), on the current and future social, economic, moral, legal, and political consequences, to the broader public, including early-stage students, these technologies and their implications can often remain abstract terms. One might have heard about IT, AI, big data, the Internet of Things, deep learning, or blockchain. Buzz words that we find frequently used in the international media. This course discusses these technologies, and systemically, in various sections throughout the semester, examines the social, ethical, moral, economic, political, and legal implications these technologies have and will have on societies globally. It will address critical societal challenges such as privacy, cybersecurity, misinformation, governance and politics in the digital age, media, business stability, ethics and morals in the digital age, and new modes of the workforce, among others. We will also look at internet governance as well as privacy protection rules in a global context for better understanding of global trends in building healthy relations between technology and society. Throughout, the course aims to educate students to think critically about the approaches and possible solutions to the challenges in the physical and virtual domain. The course serves as an introduction to these technologies and a moderate foray into Science and Technology Studies\' academic discipline. It should enable students to understand better the underlying technologies and the value of Science and Technology Studies (STS) while hopefully further arising interest in these subjects and into this academic discipline \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nGiven an introduction into the field of Science and Technology Studies.\\nProvide an understanding how academic profession studies technologies and technological changes.\\nUnderstand the complex relationship between technology, sciences and society\\nAnalyze important trends about the way and nature of current and emerging technological developments, allowing to gain an understanding on how technologies could develop further.\\nUnderstand the complex relationships between technology, sciences, innovation, economic, political and social dynamics, and societies\\nUnderstand how and why technology advancements have modified the physical and virtual environment of human societies\\nEnhance students\u2019 ability to approach complex problems critically, systematically and innovatory\\nDevelop students\u2019 capacity to position themselves in the emerging civilization age \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1: Class Introduction.

These quizzes will consist of short answer and short essay questions. You will be quizzed on the previous week\u2019s course lectures, themes, readings, and film viewings (where applicable). This means you need to keep on top of the readings, and I advise you to annotate and/or take notes on class readings. This assessment measures students\u2019 understanding of key class concepts and engagement with the course. All quizzes ask students to engage with course learning objectives through use of description and examples (drawn from their own social worlds). \\nGroup Mid-Term Outline and Annotated Bibliography (20%): For your final group project you will create a detailed encyclopedic entry on a key topic related to sex, gender, and intimacy. For this mid-term, as part of the final project, your group will create an outline and an annotated bibliography.

Its primary objective is to familiarize students with fundamental concepts and key issues related to law, politics, and society in Vietnam following the country\'s reunification. The course begins by examining the evolving structure of law and politics in Vietnam after the Vietnam War, along with the philosophical foundations, societal conflicts and political visions of the unified country. It then delves into the significant legal and political challenges faced by Vietnam during the final years of the Cold War, as well as the groundwork laid for the Doi Moi reform era. Additionally, the course investigates how classical Marxism was adapted by Vietnamese legal and political philosophers to address global changes.\\nSubsequently, the course focuses on the legal reforms of the early 1990s, led by the Vietnam Communist Party, and the development of concepts such as socialist rule of law and socialist market economy. It explores how laws were formulated as tools of governance. The course further explores Vietnam\'s legal system in the context of the country\'s global integration campaign. Specific attention is given to key legal areas such as criminal law, labor law, civil law, economic law, digital law, human rights and constitutional law. Finally, the course examines Vietnam\'s renewed interest in establishing a socialist rule of law and considers the implications of contemporary global issues on the country.\\nThroughout the course, students will be exposed to historical and comparative methods in examining the law, politics and society of Vietnam. This will raise important questions about the potential advantages and limitations of using law as an analytical category in cross-cultural studies. The course will explore the dynamics that arise when \\"Eastern\\" and \\"Western\\" legal cultures interact with each other, especially in the context of a Party State. It will also consider the significance for Marxist theorists of engaging with Western legal concepts such as contract law, company law, capital market, and human rights. Students will investigate the relationship between law, capitalism, and socialism, as well as how law shapes global political and socio-economic relations. The course will analyze how law both produces and constrains subjects and identities\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to:\\nExplain how historical and cultural forces underlay contemporary legal discourse in Vietnam.\\nIdentity and analyze key issues facing Vietnamese law today\\nApply social and legal theory to analyze law both in Vietnam and abroad.\\nDiscuss the role of law in everyday life in contemporary Vietnam.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nRequired Text: Mark Sidel, Law and Society in Vietnam: The Transition from Socialism in Comparative Perspective (Cambridge Studies in Law and Society), Cambridge University Press (March 17, 2008)\\nChanges.

Under such circumstances it is nearly impossible to foresee further international developments without understanding how China approaches the world and what shapes its behavior. How can we make sense of how China makes its foreign policy at a time of uncertainty and transformation? What is, and should be, China\u2019s role and interest in addressing myriad complex global challenges? This course will explore the major issues in Chinese foreign policymaking with a particular focus on Vietnam and the U.S. as case studies. \\nThis course provides a comprehensive understanding of Chinese foreign policy. It will begin by examining the role of history, national identity, ideology, national interests in Chinese policymaking, and then explore the major institutions and actors in the Chinese foreign policymaking system. We will then examine in-depth Chinese policy towards Vietnam and the U.S. to see how Chinese foreign policymaking works. The course will also look at the historical context behind Chinese decision-making, present-day issues, and future challenges. \\nIn this way the students are expected to grasp certain background knowledge of Chinese history, political system and foreign policy process, as well as sufficient understanding of the key concepts and developments in international relations. They will both become familiar with Chinese foreign relations and enhance their conceptual understanding of the logics behind it.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: The students are expected to:\\nUnderstand/Recognize the domestic social, economic and political forces which shaped the current Chinese foreign policy (hereinafter CFP)\\nEnhance/Perform the students\u2019 understanding of contemporary CFP and its historical development through the study of China\u2019s relations with Vietnam, the US and regions of the world, and also the key issues in these relations.\\nCommunicate with structured knowledge of CFP and enable them to independently explain CFP decisions by presenting the key principles and factors shaping CFP.\\nFormulate and conduct analytical skills; facilitate their ability to formulate and clearly express arguments in writing and oral presentations.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1.

Drawing on theories from gender studies, feminist theories, media theories (including behavioural psychology and media), students will learn how to critically analyse and evaluate the relationship between gender and media using quantitative research approaches.\\nThe course emphasises the practical aspects of conducting quantitative research in gender and media studies. Students will be introduced to the process of formulating research questions that address gender-related issues in the media (including the positionality of Vietnamese women in traditional and broker-arranged marriages, Vietnamese brides and East Asian husbands in social and popular media, etc.), and they will learn how to select appropriate quantitative methods for data collection and analysis. They will also explore different techniques for collecting quantitative data, such as surveys, content analysis, and experiments, while considering ethical considerations in research.\\nApart from acquiring essential skills in data analysis and interpreting quantitative finding, students will also learn how to report research results effectively, both in written form and through visual representations. Throughout the course, students will engage in hands-on activities, including designing and conducting their own small-to-medium scale quantitative research project that investigates gender and media phenomena in the Vietnamese context.\\nBy the end of the course, students will possess a solid foundation in applying quantitative methods to explore gender and media issues in Vietnam. They will be well-informed about the relevant theories from media and gender studies, allowing them to critically analyse the influence of media on gender perceptions, stereotypes, and representations. Additionally, students will have practical skills in formulating research questions, selecting appropriate quantitative methods, collecting and analysing data, as well as reporting research results effectively.\\nNote: This course assumes a basic understanding of media studies and gender studies. Prior knowledge of quantitative methods is also preferred, but the course will revise some basic statistics and provide comprehensive instruction on conducting quantitative research in the context of gender and media studies.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will gain an understanding about of the intersections between gender and media in the Vietnamese context.\\nStudents will employ quantitative research methods, the course equips students with analytical skills to investigate and critically analyze gender-related issues in Vietnamese media, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of Vietnamese society and culture.\\nStudents will communicate their research to a wider audience via journaling and a written report.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1: Introduction week.\\nWeek 2: Media and Gender Studies: Some Key Texts and Debates.\\nWeek 3: Media Theories: Influences and Effects on Society.\\nWeek 4: Media Developments in Vietnam.\\nWeek 5: Feminist Theories: Understanding Gender and Power.\\nWeek 6: Gender (in)equality in Vietnam: Progresses over the Years.\\nWeek 7: Gender in Media: Men vs. Women, and Everyone in Between.\\nWeek 8: Gender Representation in Vietnamese Media: Stereotypes and Challenges.\\nWeek 9 \u2013 Mid-term Break .\\nWeek 10: Quantitative Research Methods in Gender and Media Studies\\nStudents are already encouraged to think of a topic of interest to later develop it into the final project.\\nWeek 11: Ethical Considerations in Quantitative Gender and Media Research.\\nWeek 12: Formulating Research Questions/Hypotheses in Practice\\nRevision of Key Media and Gender Theories from beginning of term;\\nLearn how to formulate RQs/hypotheses based on learned theories.\\nWeek 13: Choosing the Study Design: Content Analysis, Experiment, and Survey/Questionnaire.\\nWeek 14: Proposal and Feedback on Chosen Topic of Final Project\\nStudents present their chosen topic, brief their research design, and intended analysis in front of their peers and receive feedback from both instructor and peers;\\nFinal approval by instructor before commencing the project.\\nWeek 15: Interpreting Findings and Effective Presentation of Quantitative Results.\\nWeek 16: The Implications and Future of Media and Gender Studies in Vietnam\\n\\nKey readings:\\nScholten, P.

It will provide you with an introduction to Vietnamese Studies, which is both an interdisciplinary field and a transnational community of scholars and students in Vietnam and across the world. The course incorporates scholarship and methods from multiple disciplines, with particular attention to History, Environmental Studies, and Literary and Film Studies. These interdisciplinary investigations will be linked by our focus on the theme of development in Vietnam. In this course, we will analyze development historically and contextually; we will also seek to understand it not simply as an economic process, but also as a political, social, and ideological category.\\nThis course inaugurates a new collaborative learning partnership between Dartmouth College, a member of the Ivy League founded in 1769, and Fulbright University Vietnam, a liberal arts university established in Ho Chi Minh City in 2016.

Students will choose a suggested topic or their own tentative Capstone topic of interest to prepare a research proposal. While students are expected to work on their proposal independently, teamwork is also possible (need to be approved case-by-case).\\nThe seminar structure will be flexible and be at the discretion of the faculty running the sessions. One example of the spring seminar structure includes 2 parts.\\nPart 1 (6 meetings): In this part, students focus on finding resources and conducting a literature review. In the first two meetings, faculty present their own experience on how to approach a research topic, where and how to find resources, how to conduct and write up a thorough literature review (given a research question/topic). In the next four meetings, students take turns to present their findings on their topics and receive feedback. The outcome of this part is a complete literature review.\\nPart 2 (6 meetings): Sample research proposals will be carefully analyzed by faculty in the first two meetings: how to pose a research question, how to write an introduction, how to choose methodology, and make plans. The next two meetings will be organized as Q&A sessions. Students take turns talking about their methodologies and receive feedback/suggestions from faculty. In the last two meetings, students present their research proposals as a practice defense.

Students will be introduced to key concepts related to migration and will be encouraged to critically engage with the difficulties and challenges faced by individuals and communities (of Vietnamese origin) during their migration processes.\\nThe course content delves into the multifaceted nature of migration from Vietnam, with a particular focus on the gendered aspect of the phenomenon. Students will explore how gender plays a pivotal role in shaping experiences, motivations, and vulnerabilities of Vietnamese migrants, including the exclusive obstacles faced by female migrants due to the local norms and traditions. By analysing case studies, empirical research, academic literature, and multimedia resources, students will gain insight into the diverse reasons that compel Vietnamese individuals and families to migrate, including economic opportunities, political factors, family reunification, and social aspirations.\\nThroughout the course, students will be encouraged to think critically and engage in discussions on the ethical, social, and economic implications of migration. They will examine the impacts of migration on both the sending and receiving societies, considering issues such as (gendered) identity, cultural integration, social inequality, and human rights. Furthermore, students will explore the interplay between migration policies, social structures, and individual agency, fostering an understanding of the constantly involving dynamics that shape migration processes. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with a comprehensive understanding of Vietnamese migration and how it transforms modern Vietnam. They will be able to identify and analyse the key push and pull factors driving migration, critically evaluate the gendered dimensions of migration, and appreciate the broader implications of migration on individuals and societies. The course will prepare students to engage with contemporary debates and challenges related to migration and develop a heightened awareness of the current issues surrounding migration, especially in Vietnam and the Southeast Asia region.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will gain an understanding about the broader Vietnamese diaspora and its interactions with the homeland.\\nStudents will collect and critically examine a variety of primary and secondary sources to undertake a guided research project into Vietnamese migration.\\nStudents will communicate their research to a wider audience via video and written formats.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1: Introduction week\\nLearn about students\u2019 expectations of the course/course instructor and vice versa;\\nOverview: migration as a global phenomenon\\nIntroduction to Vietnamese Migration: Historical Context and Common Migration Patterns.\\nWeek 2: Key Concepts and Theoretical Frameworks in Migration Studies.\\nWeek 3: Push/Pull Factors: Economic and Political Motivations for Migrants from Vietnam and Opportunities and Attractions in Receiving Societies.\\nWeek 4: Family and Kinship Networks\u2019 Influence on Migration in Vietnam\\nPossible guest lecturer/speaker: Lan Anh Hoang.\\nWeek 5: Gendered Dimensions of Vietnamese Migration: Roles, Expectations, and Challenges.\\nWeek 6: Internal Migration within Vietnam: Rural-Urban Dynamics.\\nWeek 7: International Labor Migration: Vietnamese Workers Abroad\\nPros and cons for the local community and economy\\nPossible guest lecturer/speaker: Isabelle Cheng.\\nWeek 8: Human Trafficking and Smuggling in Vietnam and the Southeast Asia Region.\\nWeek 9 \u2013 Mid-term Break.\\nWeek 10: Forced Migration and Refugee Movements from Vietnam.\\nWeek 11: Vietnamese Diaspora Communities: Identity, Transnationalism, and Cultural Preservation.\\nWeek 12: Remittances and Development: Economic Impacts of Vietnamese Migration.\\nWeek 13: Social Integration and Cultural Adaptation of Vietnamese Migrants\\nIn Southeast Asia vs. Western Countries.\\nWeek 14 \u2013 27/11-01/12: Social Exclusion, Discrimination, and the Marginalisation of (Returned) Vietnamese Migrants.\\nWeek 15 \u2013 04-08/12: Migration Policies and Governance: Implications for Vietnamese Migrants\\nEmerging Trends and Future Directions in Vietnamese Migration Studies\\nUrban to Rural trend: is it sustainable?\\nMigration TO Vietnam: what are the pull factors?\\n\\nKey readings:\\nScholten, P.

They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization.

A key area of investigation will be how the concepts of modernity and modernism have been expressed by artists in reaction to major technological and geopolitical developments in the twentieth century. We will situate artworks within their local contexts while remaining attentive to the transnational nature of certain movements. This postcolonial approach decenters the Eurocentric narrative of modern art and emphasizes how modernism emerged from sites of exchange and encounter between artistic communities in Asia, Europe, Africa, the United States, and Latin America. While students will gain familiarity with movements or themes such as realism, cubism, primitivism, surrealism, the Bauhaus, abstraction, and pop, a comparative approach to these practices in a global context (e.g., surrealist art in Paris and Cairo, abstraction in New York and Osaka) will help us better understand how modernism forged new directions in the nature of artistic representation, and more particularly, the artist\u2019s sense of their role in society and the larger world.\\n\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nDefine modernity and modernism in the context of art history.\\nIdentify important modern art movements and artists across a global comparative context.\\nDemonstrate competency in visual analysis, textual interpretation, and the use of art historical terminology.\\nAnalyze the connections between the formal attributes of artworks and their relevant historical, political, and cultural contexts.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nNot including days for revision/exams\\n1.

We are living in a time after the pandemic where movie theater seems to be becoming obsolete, especially due to shifts in viewing and industry practices towards streaming distribution. In turn, we should question how shifts in viewing and screening practices change how we define the cinematic experience. The course offers a new way to think about the changing spectatorship practices while also introducing Chinese-language cinema from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong since the late 1980s. Through research and writing assignments, we will focus on questions of not only where these films were produced and directed, but also how and where they were screened around the world. We will investigate past, current, and evolving viewing practices, not just in terms of circulation and screening, but also in terms of how the movie theater and theater-going are represented and commemorated within these films. Introducing major theoretical and historical scholarship on contemporary Chinese language cinema, we will consider how memories, screens, and theaters concretize the pleasure of viewing and imagining through film and media.\\n\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nCLO1.

Topics covered will include painting tools and paint, preparation processes for painting canvas supports, sizes and grounds, medium, varnishes, pigments, solvents, painting procedures, and the care of finished paintings. Students will learn the history of oil painting and be introduced to a selection of artists for insight on painting concepts, styles and techniques. Exercises and assessments will focus on developing a structured painting process. Class discussions and critiques will assist the student in developing and defending their painting concepts. There is a list of personal supplies that students must purchase for the course. It is estimated that the total cost will be around 1,000,000 VND.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nCLO1. Demonstrate advanced skill in a variety of painting methods\\nCLO2. Identify art-historical references, artists, styles, methods and techniques\\nCLO3. Analyze, evaluate and discuss artwork in formal art critique\\nCLO4. Communicate ideas through making and articulate their process while developing their unique individual style\\nCLO5. Write an artist statement\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nSection 1: Introduction to the Course\\nThe course overview and assessments, readings, required materials, art studio and safety protocols. Students will learn about the history of oil paint. Instructor will accompany students to the art store to assist them in purchasing their personal supplies for the next class.\\n\\nSection 2: Introduction to Oil Painting\\nStudents will be introduced to oil paint, mediums, and solvents. A review of color theory (with specific application to oil paint). \\nExercise: Color mixing with oils. Students will create a color chart using the Munsell method (value, hue, chroma) and a skin-tone reference chart.\\n\\nSection 3: Preparing the Support\\nStudents will learn how to stretch canvas and prepare the support for painting with layers of gesso. Students will prepare the large 80 x 60 support that will be used later in the semester for their final project.\\nHomework: Students will research and identify three painters working in oil whose style they want to emulate or are inspired by. The styles of these painters will be referenced by students in the successive class exercises and assessments, as students strive to learn from them.\\n\\nSection 4: Introduction to Alla Prima\\nStudents will be introduced to the Alla Prima (All at Once) direct method of painting, where the painting is completed within one to three days, allowing the students to work wet-on-wet, including impasto painting. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working with this method. Students will be introduced to artists and artworks related to Alla Prima painting, notably in portraiture and in plein-air painting. \\nExercise: Students begin the Alla Prima painting assessment, due next class.\\n\\nSection 5: Limited Palette \\nStudents will be introduced to a limited palette (e.g. The Zorn Palette). Students will study works that utilize a limited palette including Anders Zorn, Caravaggio, John Singer Sargent and Alpay Efe. \\nExercise: Students will be map out the Zorn Palette as preparation for the Assessment 2: The Limited Palette Painting. \\n\\n+++ASSESSMENT 1: Alla Prima Painting Due++++\\n\\nSection 6: Introduction to Plein Air Painting\\nStudents will be introduced to Plein Air (outdoor) painting, another direct painting method using paint directly from the tube to create a painting in the impressionistic style. \\nExercise: Choosing an appropriate site for plein air painting, students will work on site to complete a small plein air painting by the end of class.\\n\\nSection 7: Introduction to Indirect Painting\\nStudents will be introduced to the Indirect Painting method where the painting is constructed in layers of paint. Beginning with the sketch, imprimatur, grisaille (tonal underpainting) toward latter applications of paint in layers (fat over lean principle, glazing). This section will begin the series of painting phases culminating in a completed painting and Final Project Assessment.\\nExercise: Students will work on research material and draw sketches for their final project and prepare sketches for transfer on prepared toned canvas.\\n\\n+++ASSESSMENT 2: Limited Palette Painting Due ++++\\n\\nSection 8: Painting the Grisaille\\nStudents will learn the process of creating the tonal grisaille painting. Students will complete the grisaille of painting for the next application of color in the next class.\\n\\nSection 9: First Application of Color\\nUtilizing the fat-over-lean principle in oil painting, students will add the first lean layer of paint over the underpainting. Introduction to glazing, the addition of color using semi-transparent oil paints. *Note that direct painting requires a layer to be completely dry before painting upon. A week will be necessary for thinner layers to be ready for new layers of paint. Oil drying mediums may be used (such as Liquitex) to quicken drying times.\\n\\nSection 10: Successive Applications of Paint\\nStudents will continue toward the completion of their paintings adding new layers of color upon the dried underlayer. Focus on edge and brushstroke variation.\\n\\nSection 11: Finishing the Indirect Painting \\nStudents will work to finish their paintings with final layers and details.\\n\\nSection 12: Final Project Critique Part 1 (50% of class)\\nStudents will present their final projects work in progress in class critiques. Students will learn about the value of constructive criticism, both in giving and receiving. \\n\\n+++ASSESSMENT 3: Final Project Paintings are due +++\\n\\nSection 13: Final Project Critique Part 2 (50% of class)\\nStudents will present their final projects work in progress in class critiques. Students will learn about the value of constructive criticism, both in giving and receiving. \\n\\nSection 14: Final Course Review\\nWe will reflect on the studio practice of oil painting and discuss ways to continue experimentation with the medium for future works.\\nReadings from:\\nGregg Kreutz.

This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future. Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a research field that studies how to realize the intelligent human behaviors on a computer. The ultimate goal of AI is to make a computer that can learn, plan, and solve problems autonomously. In this course, student will learn the foundational principles and practice implementing some of these applications including representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence. Accordingly, students should be able to develop intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems; understand the role of knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning in intelligent-system engineering; and appreciate the role of problem solving, vision, and language in understanding human intelligence from a computational perspective.\\n ---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes\\nThe main purpose of this course is to provide the most fundamental knowledge to the students so that they can understand what the AI is. Students who become interested in AI may go on to the graduate school for further study.

By definition, a signal is any observable change in quantity over space or time. It could help observers to obtain information about a phenomenon. In nature, signals can be actions done by organisms to alert other organisms or sounds or motions by animals to alert other animals of danger or food. Advances in technology have improved the capabilities of human beings to identify, analyze and even synthesize diverse information sources such as audio (speech, acoustics, music), image (photos, videos, multimedia, medical scans), medical signals (heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity) and remote sensing data (geophysical, sensing, radar). In principle, signals could be represented as data values or abstractly as mathematical expressions. A system converts or manipulate an input signal into an output signal. Examples of systems are face recognition, video streaming, cellular phones, and smart homes.

Like many of the explorers you will meet along the way, you will travel across time from when Chinggis Khan\u2019s armies conquered China and Baghdad in the 13th century and the Black Death scoured the Eurasian world a century later right up to the globalization of our day. Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age? How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. The aim of this course is to understand the big forces that pull the world\u2019s parts together as well as those that drive them apart. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects you to students elsewhere in the world. Across 22 locations around the world, students are taking the same course simultaneously and posting and sharing their ideas on the course Gallery site.\\n---\\nTentative Weekly Lectures:\\nWeek 1:\\nLecture 1: Peoples and Plunderers\\nLecture 2: Warfare and Motion\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 11\\nFirst Town Hall\\nFirst team meeting but no readings \u2013 just to discuss the format of teamwork.\\nWeek 2:\\nLecture 3: Clashing Worlds\\nLecture 4: Atlantic Worlds\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 12\\nSecond Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 1\\nWeek 3:\\nLecture 5: Indian Ocean Worlds\\nLecture 6: The Worlds that Merchants Made\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 13\\nThird Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 2\\nWeek 4:\\nLecture 7: East Asian Dynamism and the Seventeenth-Century Global Crisis\\nLecture 8: Empire and Enlightenment\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 14\\nFourth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 3\\nWeek 5:\\nLecture 9: The World in Revolution\\nLecture 10: States and Nations\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 15\\nFifth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 4\\nWeek 6:\\nLecture 11: Global Frontiers\\nLecture 12: Empires and Nations\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 16\\nIn-class midterm exam\\nNo Town Hall; no Team meeting\\nWeek 7:\\nLecture 13: Worlds in Motion\\nLecture 14: Empire Redux\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 17\\nSixth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 5\\nWeek 8:\\nLecture 15: Retreat of the Elephants\\nLecture 16: The World, 1914\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 17\\nSeventh Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 6\\nWeek 9:\\nLecture 17: Civilization and its Discontents\\nLecture 18: Worlds at War\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 18\\nEighth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 7\\nWeek 10:\\nLecture 19: Atrocities\\nLecture 20: Aftermaths\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 19\\nNinth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 8\\nWeek 11:\\nLecture 21: Recoveries\\nLecture 22: Inventing the Third World\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 20\\nWeek 12:\\nLecture 23: Crisis and Globalization\\nLecture 24: The Cunning of History\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 21\\nTenth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 9\\nFinal Exam\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\nMid-term exam: 15%\\nFinal Exam: 35%\\nPrecept/Team participation: 50%","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"}],"location":"Classroom 502"},{"title":"US in the World","id":"HIS108_Spring2024_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Philip Catton","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdfXhQAI/his108spring2024s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Philip Catton\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThe Spanish-American War of 1898 marked the entry of the United States into a new era of global engagement, as it administered populous overseas territories, engaged actively in spreading its liberal ideology and socio-economic vision, and reframed its conceptions of national and international security. Since then, it has become the leading global power, whose foreign policy not only disproportionately impacts other nations, but shapes the very structure of the international system. A grasp of American diplomatic history has become indispensable to anyone wishing to understand international politics from the beginning of the 20th century onwards.\\nThis course examines the evolution of American foreign policy through the 20th century, covering all the major events and debates of that time period, including the American decision to intervene in World War I and its consequences; the impact of America\u2019s isolationist foreign policy during the interwar years; the causes and consequences of World War II; the origins of the Cold War and American strategy; the creation and collapse of the American-led postwar economic system; American relations with allies and enemies in the Third World; and the United States in the post-Cold War World. We will also explore a range of macro-themes, including the role of ideology, race, religion, domestic politics, the institutional environment, and individual leaders in the making of American foreign policy.\\nThe goal of the course is to introduce students to the study of American foreign policy after 1898. Students will become familiar with important events, personalities, and theoretical perspectives. Students will be introduced to a range of opinions through secondary sources and trained to properly evaluate and use primary sources. Students will be expected to integrate these sources to produce two medium-length essays of five double-spaced pages each, with clear structures, coherent arguments supported by evidence where appropriate, and correct citation. Students will come away from the course with improved critical reading and argumentative writing skills, which are highly valued in most careers in an information economy.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nIdentify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\\nExplain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\\nExplain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\\nExplain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\\nPropose solutions to current challenges in dealing with the US in the world\\nCritically analyze and interpret primary sources\\nClearly articulate their ideas in written and verbal form\\n---\\nTentative Class Schedule\\nWeek 1:\\nStart Unit 1: The Cold War \\nDiscuss Rubric and Assignment Guide for Assignment 1 \\nKnow-What-Learn (KWL) to assess your knowledge of the Cold War and identify learning goals for this unit. \\nYou will individually fill out the first two columns of a KWL chart\u2014what do you know about the Cold War?

The wars in Vietnam evolved from an anti-colonial struggle into a superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As conflict in Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states and non-state actors.\\nThis course will examine critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers become so deeply involved in Vietnamese affairs? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? And what are the global legacies of the war?\\nIn addition to examining its origins and evolution, the course will use the conflict to explore broader international events and trends, including empire and decolonization, the Chinese Civil War, the Sino-Soviet Split, D\xe9tente, and the Cambodian Genocide.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nIdentify and contextualize the main events and key figures in the history of the Vietnam conflict\\nExplain the origins, evolution, and consequences of the Vietnam conflict\\nAssess the scholarship on the conflict and demonstrate an understanding of the historical debates about its causes and effects\\nDemonstrate the ability to articulate complex ideas and interpretations verbally and in writing\\nCritically analyze a range of primary and secondary sources\\nEvaluate the interplay between domestic politics and foreign affairs in a wide range of global contexts\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1:\\nCourse Introduction\\nThe Origins and Character of France\u2019s Indochina Empire\\nReading: Aviel Roshwald, \u201cColonial Dreams of the French Right Wing, 1881-1914,\u201d The Historian (1994); plus some primary sources. \\n\\nWeek 2:\\nVietnamese Anti-colonialism\\nReading: Christopher E.

Students will be expected to have a general knowledge of modern European history.\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n---\\nCourse Description: \\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, European civilization lay in ruins. Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at \u201ctrials\u201d real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and \u201cshow\u201d trials, trials of terrorists and \u201ccounter-terrorists,\u201d as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe\u2019s changing political landscape.\\n\u201cEurope on Trial\u201d is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans\u2014the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma. Students taking this course will witness how and why Europeans have constantly reexamined their past. In so doing, they will better understand Europe\u2019s present and gain a framework for analyzing more universal questions of balancing order with civil liberties, justice, and power beyond the European continent. \\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nUnderstand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Europe since 1945.\\nCompare and contrast how various postwar European political and legal systems deployed the law to address issues of justice, security, democracy, religion, and historical memory.\\nAnalyze critically visual, textual, literary, legal, and archival documentation.\\nEvaluate primary and secondary sources to address fundamental questions of historical change in Europe since 1945.\\nCraft evidence-based argumentation through written assignments that address the historical role of political systems on law and law on political systems in Europe since the end of the Second World War.\\n---\\nSample Reading List\\nMain readings for the class will include excerpts from the following texts:\\nWilliam Hitchcock, The Struggle for Europe: The Turbulent History of a Divided Continent, 1945 to the Present (New York: Anchor Books, 2004)\\nAlice Kaplan, The Collaborator: The Trial and Execution of Robert Brasillach (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001)\\nMichael R.

Topics covered include Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry (and anti-Masonic conspiracy theories), Sebastianism, the mass hysteria at Loudun, Protestant and Catholic witchcraft panic, Waldensianism, early modern appropriations of Joachim of Fiore (including by Christopher Columbus), Catholic and Protestant conspiracy theories about the other, anti-Jesuit sentiment, the Man in the Iron Mask, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (an antisemitic modification of earlier conspiracies unrelated to Judaism), the Orange Order, the KKK, and finally anti-Masonic and anti-Jesuit conspiracism in the Spanish Civil War and the Violencia in Colombia. Student research can cover any cult, occult organization or conspiratorial belief since 1450. With any luck we will also touch on a few Asian appropriations of the European occult and conspiracy beliefs touched on earlier, such as the Taiping Rebellion and the Cao Dai religion.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nStudents will explore scholarly definitions of \u201ccults\u201d (vs religions) and \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d (vs documented closed-door agendas, for example the Wannsee conference) and arrive at a working definition of each which assists them in understanding remaining course readings and provides the intellectual and methodological infrastructure for their own research.\\nStudents will explore and adopt oral history methods in order to compare the internal understanding of members of nonmainstream religious groups about their organization\u2019s history versus external, scholarly, academic, journalistic and mainstream understandings of the same history.\\nStudents will learn to analyze, verbally and in writing, ambiguously fringe, abusive, seditious or otherwise unstable groups with nuance, intellectual rigor and a certain amount of sympathy for members\u2019 self-understanding, including for groups which no longer exist but were important historically. \\nStudents will explore the contentious historiography around many important nonstandard or new religious/occult/esoteric groups and their contribution to (or lack thereof) major historical events. They will come to understand how conspiracy theories around such groups often have more explanatory power than the groups themselves. \\nStudents will learn about historical conspiracy theories around unequivocally noncult religious groups (e.g. Protestants, Muslims, Catholics/Jesuits, Jews) and/or ethnic minorities, the accompanying racialization and pathologization of practitioners/members, and associated violence. They will identify patterns of escalation and deescalation and explore questions of demarcation between religious groups and the racialization of religion beginning in the early modern era. \\nStudents will think critically about which historical assumptions by conspiracists, cult members, witchfinders, and genuine conspirators continue to manifest themselves in the present day, as well as instances of successful \u201cdeprogramming\u201d or deescalation of violence in the context of their applicability to the present.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1: Renaissance occultism, astrology, Hermeticism, Giordano Bruno, The \u201cCheese and the Worms\u201d\\nExcerpts: Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition by Frances Yates\\nExcerpts: The Cheese and the Worms by Carlo Ginzburg\\nMaurizio Campanelli, \u201cMarsilio Ficino\'s portrait of Hermes Trismegistus and its afterlife\u201d\\n\\nWeek 2: The panic at Loudun, witchcraft panic in the Protestant and Catholic world, real Renaissance serial killers\\nWilliam Smith, \u201cFriedrich F\xf6rner, the Catholic Reformation, and Witch-Hunting in Bamberg\u201d\\nIldiko Kristov, \u201c\u201cCharming Sorcerers\u201d or \u201cSoldiers of Satan\u201d?

The title of this course asks: what does it mean to be human? We will expand on that question by also asking: have technological advancements changed the definition of humanity? In what ways does the definition of humanity dependent upon other social factors such as gender, race, dis/ability, class, and nationality? And, how has literature been used as a technology for determining humanity? Through a discussion-based classroom, we will approach these questions by reading and comparing texts from multiple different literary genres, including fiction, poetry, nonfiction, and film. In this course, we will also learn to appreciate the aesthetic and functional quality of texts, focusing on style, intertextuality, and critical value. We will also explore different ways of approaching texts depending on their genre and form, and practice important skills such as close reading, developing arguments, and expressing ideas clearly orally and in writing. Finally, the course will also prompt students to question the value of literature in contemporary society, and how to make connections beyond the material with the world around them. \\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nDeveloping an argument and organized structure in a written essay\\nMaking appropriate use of primary and secondary sources as supporting evidence for claims in an essay\\nUtilizing preparatory writing strategies such as drafting, revising, and peer review to conceptualize ideas\\nIdentifying and analyzing the literary qualities of at least two forms or genres\\nConnecting the material beyond the text to other disciplines and contexts\\nObtain a working knowledge of the connection between literature/writing/language and technology, especially in regards to how literature has historically been used as a technology for determining humanity alongside other vectors of power such as gender, race, dis/ability, class, etc.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nThis course would be divided thematically into three units.

We will ask: what is epic literature? How do texts construct literary heroes, and why are they important? What role do national heroes and epic figures play in our perception of our own culture, our community, and the outside world? Over the course of the semester, we will discover how foundational texts of epic literature from the often-misunderstood Middle Ages and early modern era ultimately underpin modern epic fantasies like Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, or Avatar. Topics may include the power of myth, epic propaganda, the warrior hero, the monstrous other, visions of masculinity throughout time, and the role of women in the hero\u2019s journey. Moreover, this class will look at medieval and early modern epics from a wide variety of cultures, both Western and non-Western, in order to challenge the idea of the universal hero; instead, we will examine how heroic and epic narratives were deeply intertwined with the values and beliefs of the cultures that produced them.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to\\nStrengthen reading and analytical skills\\nObtain a working knowledge of the epic tradition and compare Western conventions of epic with the epic in other venues (the Middle East, the Far East, etc.)\\nUnderstand how literary conventions build over time and deepen our understanding of influence (both horizontal and vertical\u2014intercultural and temporal)\\nMake connections between literary works and the society or time period that produced them\\nStrengthen argumentative ability, both orally and in writing\\nExpand their understanding of a major literary time period (the medieval) and familiarize themselves with some of its major canonical works\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nReading schedule\\nUnit 1: Foundations of Epic Literature\\nWeek 1: Course introduction\\nDay 1: Course introduction, classroom contract activity, syllabus review\\nDay 2: \u201cThe Hero Monomyth\u201d (Campbell) & Lord Raglan\u2019s characteristics\\nWeek 2: Establishing the genre of epic literature\\nDay 1: Epic of Gilgamesh I (Babylonian)\\nDay 2: Epic of Gilgamesh II (Babylonian)\\nWeek 3: Establishing the genre of epic literature\\n- Day 1: The Odyssey (excerpts: his pride, Cyclops, Calypso, and Circe episodes) (Greek)\\n- Day 2: The Odyssey (excerpts: Scylla and Charybdis, Penelope, and Odysseus\u2019 return) (Greek)\\n\\nUnit 2: The national medieval epic (8th-12th centuries)\\nWeek 4: Anglo-Saxon England \\nDay 1: History Day: Anglo-Saxon culture (5-10th c.) \\nDay 2: Anglo-Saxon culture: \u201cThe Battle of Maldon\u201d & \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d (Old English)\\nWeek 5: Anglo-Saxon England  \\nDay 1: Beowulf I (Grendel episode) (Old English)\\nDay 2: Beowulf II (Grendel\u2019s mother episode) (Old English)\\nWeek 6: Anglo-Saxon England/Transition week\\nDay 1: Beowulf III (Dragon episode) (Old English) \\nDay 2: History and material culture day: The medieval Persian Empire \\nPaper 1 due @ the end of this week\\nWeek 7: Persian national epic\\nDay 1: Shahnameh I (Birth and exile of Zal) (Persian)\\nDay 2: Shahnameh II (Return of Zal and Rudaba episode) (Persian)\\nWeek 8: Persian national epic\\nDay 1: Shahnameh III (Birth of Rostam and his exploits) (Persian)\\nDay 2: Shahnameh IV (Rostam and Shaghad\u2019s betrayal) (Persian)\\nWeek 9: Midterm break\\nWeek 10: Al-Andalusia and medieval Spain (the age of chivalry)\\nDay 1: History day\u2014 the Chivalric Era (12-15th c.) and the Reconquista\\nDay 2: The Poem of the Cid, Cantar I (Spanish)\\nWeek 11: Al-Andalusia and medieval Spain (the age of chivalry)\\nDay 1: The Poem of the Cid, Cantar II (Spanish)\\nDay 2: The Poem of the Cid, Cantar III (Spanish)\\nPaper 2 due @ the end of this week\\nWeek 12: Medieval France\\nDay 1: Chanson de Roland I (French)\\nDay 2: Chanson de Roland II (French)\\nUnit 3: Early modern iterations \u2013 the epic in a changing world (1605-1820)\\nWeek 13: Mock epic and the changing world\\nDay 1: Don Quixote I (chapters 1-7) (Spanish)\\nDay 2: Don Quixote II (chapters 8-15) (Spanish)\\nWeek 14: Early modern Vietnam\\nDay 1: The Tale of Kieu I (Vietnamese)\\nDay 2: The Tale of Kieu II (Vietnamese)\\nWeek 15: Course wrap-up\\nDay 1: Modern epics (by student selection) \\nDay 2: Modern epics (by student selection)\\nFinal project due by the end of this week\\n ---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\n20% Participation & Attendance\\n14% Reading quizzes (7 x 2% each)\\n20% Paper 1 (Close analysis/change over text paper)\\n20% Paper 2 (Historical Context/Values paper)\\n26% Final Wiki Project (6% proposal, 20% final)","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Music/Dance Room (BW)"},{"title":"Contemporary Poetry","id":"LIT312_Spring2024_S01","credits":null,"instructor":"Jasmine An","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdizYQAQ/lit312spring2024s01","description":"Faculty: Jasmine An - E: jasmine.an@fulbright.edu.vn\\nPre-requisite: Completion of all CORE AND either LIT 1XX (LIT 101, LIT 102, LIT 104) or LIT 103/LIT 201 Critical Methods in Literary Studies\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nPoetry is one of the oldest literary art forms and at first glance also one of the most inaccessible. Yet, in the contemporary moment, people across the world are increasingly (re)turning to poetry as mode of grappling with the inconceivable contradictions of modern life: pandemics, authoritarian regimes, climate change, births and deaths, quotidian celebrations, stubborn joy. \u201cI don\u2019t think poems will save us\u2014us, as in, this country, this world,\u201d writes Marlin M. Jenkins, \u201cBut poems continue to save me.\u201d \\nWhat, then, does a poem do? This course introduces students to contemporary poetry by exploring the multifaceted answers to this guiding question. Rather than attempting a comprehensive survey, we will focus our reading to trace poetic actions or what specific poems \u201cdo.\u201d In addition to poems, we will also read a selection of prose essays written by poets about poetry. Through our reading, we will situate each poem and its poetic action within the broader sociopolitical and historical context in which it was written. We will also learn to identify and analyze key poetic elements such as form, sound, lyricism, and movement. Readings will mainly consist of poets writing in English post-1975 such as Victoria Chang, Mai Der Vang, Claudia Rankine, Warsan Shire, Philip Metres, and others.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to\\nIdentify and analyze key poetic elements such as form, sound, and lyricism.\\nObtain a working knowledge of key genre differences between poetry and other literary forms (and also important overlaps).\\nMake connections between diverse poetic elements and the sociopolitical context of the poem\u2019s creation.\\nImprove their reading and analytical skills for diverse forms of poetry.\\nImprove their written and oral communication skills.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nRequired Texts:\\nMany of the primary texts for this class will be sourced from the contemporary archives of online literary journals.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \\n---\\nCourse Learning Objectives:\\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \\nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \\nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\n\\nUnit One: Foundational Questions\\nThis unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. \\nThe primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. \\nEach week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d\\nThis unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \\n Unit Two: The Human Experience\\nThis unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. \\nEach week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis. \\nDifferent iterations of the class can select form a list of topics depending upon the instructor\u2019s preference.

Case studies are among the essential, oldest, and fundamental research methodologies within the spectrum of qualitative research methods in social sciences. In the disciplines of political science, international relations, gender studies, communication, and media studies, among others, case studies are essential methodological tools for conducting research. As Baxter and Jack (2008) note, \u201cQualitative case study are a valuable method for [\u2026] research to develop theory, evaluate programs, and develop interventions\u201d (Baxter & Jack, 2008, p.544). Case studies allow researchers and students to understand complex to generate theories, test theories, and explore new research directions, illustrating their importance as qualitative research methods (Bhattacherje, 2008). \\nThis course will introduce students to the methodology of case study research and what a case study is. Throughout the course, students will learn about the theoretical framework of case studies, their structure, their importance, and the type of case studies in existence and widely used in social sciences. Furthermore, it discusses and highlights the (ongoing) debate in social sciences on case studies. Subsequently, students will learn how to develop their own case study research design and execute their case study research. \\nThe sum of this allows students to gain: An in-depth understanding of the importance and utility of case studies as essential research methods in social sciences, as well introduce them to developing research designs, with a particular focus on case study research design and finally gain experience in conducting case study research.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nCLO1: Students will learn about qualitative research methods \u2013 in particular case study research.\\nCLO2: Students will understand the importance of case study research, as a research method, and for social sciences.\\nCLO3: Students will learn how to conduct case study research methods (and apply these to the social sciences).\\nCLO4: Students gain practical experience conducting case study research\\nCLO5: Students gain practical experience in conducting research as a team.\\nCLO6: Develop the ability to evaluate and critique existing case study studies and identify strengths and weaknesses.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nBlock 1 Theoretical Foundations\\nWeek 1 Intro\\nWeek 2 Social Science Research and qualitative research methods.\\nWeek 3 What is the case study research?\\nWeek 4 Case study research in social sciences.\\nWeek 5 Case study research.

Discuss a well or poorly conducted case study (20%). For the first assessment of the course, students are expected to write a 500-word essay focusing on a chosen case study. In this assignment, they will summarize the case study, explain why they chose it, and argue why it was a well-conducted or poorly conducted case study. \\nMidterm assessment: Design your case study research design (30%). The midterm aims to have students apply the theoretical foundations they learned and subsequently develop their own case study research design. This assessment will be conducted in groups of 4 to 6 students. The assessment length would be around 2000 words per group submission.\\nFinal term assessment: Execute your case study research (40%). For the final term assignment, students will conduct their case study research, again in a group of 4 to 6 students. Ideally, this is based on their midterm research design, but they can propose an entirely new project if desired. This assessment aims to have students learn how to conduct their own case study research. Students will use the final block \u201cpractice\u201d to execute their research design. In-class hours will be used to discuss research designs and execution, guide students, and for peer assessment. The expected length of their case study is about 3000 words per group submission. \\nAttendance (10%). Students are expected to participate in all classes, with a maximum of 3 classes absent.

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Language is not just about communication, words such as \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  \\nLanguage is intimately tied to experience \u2013 the way we talk about an event has a bearing on how we understand that event \u2013 were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d, or an insult? As much as language is something that humans produce, language is also part of what makes us human.  \\nThis course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in the study of language, beginning with philosophical questions on the origins of human language, the creation of linguistics as a distinct field of research, and the terms by which scholars have considered the relationships between language and culture.  Core concepts include linguistic relativity, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. Core themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.  \\nPlease note, this is not a linguistics course. We will not be learning new languages or emphasizing the technical components of syntax and use. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as many core texts will be in English and draw upon English.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nStudents Will Be Able To:\\n\u2022 Understand the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology as it commonly appears in academic texts.\\n\u2022 Identify the role of language in their own culture and thought with increasing amounts of subtlety and depth.  \\n\u2022 Employ key concepts from sociolinguistics in oral discussions and both a written paper and exam.  \\n\u2022 Develop and execute a research project relating to language, culture, and thought in their own lives.\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\nClass Participation -- 20%\\nThird-Term Exam -- 20%\\nArticle Review -- 10%\\nFinal Project Presentation -- 20%\\nFinal Project Paper -- 30%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"11:30:00","end_time":"13:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"11:30:00","end_time":"13:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 6 (BW)"},{"title":"Advanced Quantitative Research Methods","id":"SOCI311_Spring2024_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Ethan Brown","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdjKrQAI/soci311spring2024s01","description":"Faculty: Ethan C.

The SRV Constitution\u2019s goal of building \u201ca progressive culture deeply imbued with national identity\u201d has guided Vietnamese policy since 1992 and figures into national strategies for sustainable development for the coming decades. Similar challenges have faced many countries around the world as they undergo rapid industrialization and post-industrialization. Responding to those challenges, an array of international treaties has been developed to support national efforts and international cooperation.\\nThis 300-level course provides an overview of the development and evolution of concepts of \u201ccultural heritage\u201d over the past century and around the world, examines the existing international legal framework, and analyzes Vietnamese responses (legal and regulatory as well as practical). The course approaches heritage from the perspectives of anthropology and critical heritage studies, combining intensive analyses of heritage policy with case studies of how such policies are applied on the ground. Special attention will be given to examining recent controversies in Vietnam over different aspects of cultural heritage. The focus will be on built cultural heritage (monuments and relics) and intangible cultural heritage.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nCLO1: Situate Vietnam\u2019s approach to cultural heritage within global trends and frameworks, highlighting the Vietnamization of those international concepts and approaches\\nCLO2: Develop critical reading skills as applied to international treaties, Vietnamese domestic laws, and Vietnamese implementing regulations, emphasizing responsibilities of citizens and the state\\nCLO3: Research and analyze current cases and controversies in Vietnam\u2019s application of international heritage treaties and domestic heritage laws, highlighting critical contributions of leading Vietnamese scholars\\nCLO4: Understand how issues of heritage and identity pose fundamental challenges to Vietnamese citizens, especially young ones, as they seek to ensure a sustainable future\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nTemporary link for readings and documents: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gLaO1gAtdRtlW4Kh90BNbe9Gyv11MnOY?usp=sharing [asterisks indicate works available both in English and in Vietnamese]\\n\\nWeek one: introduction and objectives of the course\\nIntroduction of professor and students; review of syllabus and course requirements\\nGleason, Philip. 1983.

Its impact, both positive and negative, has economic, ethical, political, and sociological consequences and alters every aspect of our society. This impact process has been, however one in which accountability has been difficult. Such brings up the question: Can we control technological development? Should we even? If so, by what means, by whom, how, under which conditions, and with which tools?  \\nThe question of how to address these issues is at the heart of studies by scholars of governance. Governance refers to \\"all processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market, or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms, power or language. Governance differs from government in that it focuses less on the state and its institutions and more on social practices and activities.\\" (Bevir, 2012). \\nThis course provides an overview of how society seeks to control, steer, and manage technology and technological change. It will introduce students to critical actors and concepts of governance and technological governance and the role of various actors in this process. Students will learn to answer questions, such as identifying technological change, what role society has in this process, what political, legal, ethical, and social frameworks exist for such governance, and who decides the governance conditions. \\nUsing case studies on the internet, AI technology, and climate change, students will apply the theoretical learnings of this course practically, enabling them to think, engage, and write critically about technology and technological governance. \\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nCLO 1 Students will learn about governance and technological governance, its function and importance in the social sciences.\\nCLO 2 Students will scientifically research on governance, technological change and tech governance. \\nCLO 3 Students will present their research output in written form and through presentations.\\nCLO 4 Students will learn, understand and analyze how society react, and (seeks to) control technology and its impact. \\nCLO 5 Students will be able to apply the course learnings into their own life and Vietnamese society, and understand societal needs and reactions to technology and technological change.\\nCLO 6 Students will gain further broader learning about political sciences, sociology and science, technology and society studies.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nBlock 1: Introduction.\\nWeek 01: Course Introduction.\\nWeek 02: Understanding governance.\\nWeek 03: Understanding technological governance.\\n\\nBlock 2: Actors of governance.\\nWeek 04: The role of governments in technological governance.\\nWeek 05: The role of commercial actors in technological governance.\\nWeek 06: The role of society in technological governance.\\n\\nBlock 3 Influences of technological change and its impact on technological governance.\\nWeek 07 Equality or inequality?

The past three decades have seen Vietnam increasingly rising as a political as well as economic power in the Southeast Asian region. Given its growing economic size and political influence, Vietnam\u2019s regional footprint is progressively noticeable. This course helps students understand how politics, history, culture, and customs could have an impact on the rapidly changing economy and society in contemporary Vietnam. It will focus on the discussion how political, economic and social forces shape a \u201csocialism-oriented market economy\u201d as the Vietnamese government claims. Put simply, the primary focus is on the interrelationships among individuals, governments, and public policy. The course is organized into two broad primary portions: 1) The history of Vietnam and the Vietnam\u2019s economic renovation (Doi Moi) since 1986; and 2) Contemporary issues the country is facing. This first part will only capture the key periods and turning points in historical Vietnam, which is necessary for understanding how historical institutions continue to shape the nation\u2019s politics and economy today. The remainder of the course will be on the Vietnamese economic reform since 1986 and contemporary issues, with an emphasis on the relationship between politics and economic development, plus cross-country comparisons as well as key challenges facing the Vietnamese Communist Party leadership, such as regime stability, pollution, and political reform.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nAt the end of this course, the ultimate objectives of this course are that students should have a familiarity with and knowledge of \\nVietnam from the interplay of the so-called socialist ideology and \u201csocialism-oriented market economy,\u201d \\nThe hierarchical structure and decision-making process of the Vietnamese government, \\nThe distinctive dynamic of politics, economy, and legal system in Vietnam, and how it differs from other western models. \\nThe course improves students\u2019 ability to think about Vietnam\u2019s complex development more comprehensively and critically; and \\nIt also enables students to integrate what they have learned into other Vietnam-related courses in their chosen academic (inter-)discipline(s).\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\nThe final grade shall be determined as follows:\\nAttendance 10%\\nParticipation in discussions 10%\\nBi-weekly responses 40% (10% each)\\nFinal group project (40%) ","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"16:15:00"}],"location":"Ting Foundation"},{"title":"Theory & Method in Vietnam Studies","id":"VS205_Spring2024_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Nicolas Weber","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdjKdQAI/vs205spring2024s01","description":"Faculty: Vu Minh Hoang\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nPre-requisite: Completion of CORE102 Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society.

Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Students will be exposed to \u201cVietnamese Studies\u201d currently practiced inside and outside Vietnam to realize which approaches have been employed in this interdisciplinary field, and how the field significantly varies in different geo-political, socio-cultural environments, depending on who is doing it and in which contexts it is carried out. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. Finally, students will have a chance to redefine \u201cVietnam Studies\u201d at Fulbright University Vietnam and figure out which directions it is heading towards.

Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts.\\nNowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular. Based on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes: Having finished this course, students will:\\n1.

Taught in a pre-seminar teaching format that combines lectures with in-class discussions, the course employs an interdisciplinary approach that allows students to understand this concept/practice through a variety of lenses, such as history, culture, and applied psychology. Following this direction, Secular mindfulness will be examined historically to see the formation, reconstruction, and transmission of it from wartime Vietnam to the world and back to postwar developing Vietnam. Moreover, during this course, students will have the chance to practice mindfulness and reflect on it in familial, communal, national, and international contexts.

At the same time, Cold War remnants (a divided Korea and China) and major geopolitical shifts (the rise of China and India, decline of US and Japan) contribute significantly to the volatility of our world. This course will examine the political, economic, and geopolitical dynamism of the region through a survey of relations among the great powers in East Asia from the sixteenth century to the present. Special emphasis will be given to regional and global developments from the perspective of the four principal East Asian states\u2014China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam. We will explore the many informal, as well as formal, means of intercourse that have made East Asia what it is today.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\n(CLO1) History: Students will develop a broad grasp of East Asian diplomacy and a deep understanding of specific events and historical figures.  \\n(CLO2) Reading: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources and between scholarly and non-scholarly texts. They will also learn to critically evaluate texts. \\n(CLO3) Expression: Students will hone their skills in both written and oral expression. \\n(CLO4) Interpretation: Students will recognize competing narratives and make judgments about such narratives through context and appreciation of historical contingency. \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek I Introduction \\nNo Readings \\n\\nWeek II \u201cChinese World Order\u201d \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Intro, Chps. 1, 5: Origins; Mature Trajectories (pp. 1-30; 132-49) \\nSpence, The Question of Hu, Chps. 1-3 (pp. 3-43) \\nPrimary: *\u201cThe Imperial Order and Han Syntheses\u201d (2nd cent, BCE), pp. 283-92 \\nWeek III Korean and Japanese appropriation of Chinese World Order (14th-17th cent) \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chps. 5, 6: Confucian Korea; Warrior Japan; Reunification Japan (pp.149-66; 187-94) \\nSpence, The Question of Hu, Chps. 4-8 (pp. 44-104) \\nPrimary: *\u201cAdmonition to the New King\u201d (1392), pp. 274-6 \\n*Ronald Toby, \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass of Protocol,\u201d pp. 168-197 \\n\\nWeek IV East Meets West: Canton (18th century), \u201ctreaty port\u201d system (19th century) \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chps. 6, 8: Ming, Qing China; 19th Century Encounter; Treaty Ports (pp. 167-83; 217-25; 230-2) \\nSpence, The Question of Hu, Chps. 9-11 (pp. 105-34) \\nPrimary: *\u201cLd Macartney\u2019s Cmmssn from Henry Dundas,\u201d etc. (1792-3), pp. 92-109 \\n*\u201cMemorial on Legalizing Opium (1836), pp. 110-4 \\n Week V Treaty port in Japan and Korea (to 1880s) \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chps. 6, 8: Hermit Kingdom; World Upside Down; 19th Century Opening of Korea; Meiji Restoration (pp. 183-6; 195-8; 235-8; 240-4) \\nCai, Miscellany of the South Seas, pp. 14-44 \\nPrimary: *\u201dDebates over Open J\u201d (Tokugawa Nariaki, Ii Naosuke [1853]), pp. 281-8 \\n*Kim Okkyun, \u201cKapsin Reform Edict\u201d (1884), p. 995-6 \\n\\nWeek VI 19th Century Border Crossings \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chp. 8: Domestic Rebellions; Tongzhi Restoration; Meiji Restoration (225-30; 244-51) \\nCai, Miscellany, pp. 47-109 \\nPrimary: *\u201cJournal of Townsend Harris\u201d (1857-8), pp. 117-22 \\n*\u201cYung Wing advises the Taiping and Zeng Guofan\u201d (1859, 63), pp. 150-4 \\n\\nWeek VII Japanese and American Empires (latter 19th century) \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chp. 8: 19th Century Opening of Korea (pp. 238-40) \\nCai, Miscellany, pp. 111-32 \\nPrimary: *Min Yonghwan, \u201cOne Policy out of a Thousand\u201d (1894), pp. 26-34 \\n*Alfred T.
