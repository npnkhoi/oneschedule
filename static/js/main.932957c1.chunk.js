Artificial intelligence (AI) is a research field that studies how to realize the intelligent human behaviors on a computer. The ultimate goal of AI is to make a computer that can learn, plan, and solve problems autonomously. In this course, student will learn the foundational principles and practice implementing some of these applications including representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence. Accordingly, students should be able to develop intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems; understand the role of knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning in intelligent-system engineering; and appreciate the role of problem solving, vision, and language in understanding human intelligence from a computational perspective.\\n ---\\nLearning Objectives\\nThe main purpose of this course is to provide the most fundamental knowledge to the students so that they can understand what the AI is. Students who become interested in AI may go on to the graduate school for further study. Upon the successful completion of this course students will be able to:\\nAbility to apply knowledge of AI techniques and synthesize solutions to the discipline and ability to develop a range of typical applications using artificial intelligence methods.\\nAbility to represent knowledge corresponding to practical problems, design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs by properly using classical search algorithms, including breadth-first, depth-first, A*, and heuristic search.\\nAbility to produce intelligent applications of machine learning with statistical learning methods (Na\xefve Bayes), supervised and unsupervised learning models: decision tree, neural networks, single-layer (perceptron) and multilayer networks\\n---\\nTextbook and References\\nArtificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents by Poole and Mackworth.

We first discuss the history of ideas in anthropological theory surrounding ideas of power and social change: early functionalist approaches presumed static traditions, whereas Marxist, feminist and postcolonial intellectual movements invited anthropologists to theorize structure and agency, power and contradiction, dialectics and change. Common-sense notions of \u201csocial movement\u201d still pose a conceptual challenge to anthropology and ethnography as a method: What distinguishes a social movement from social change broadly put? An anthropological approach to politics means that the modern western delimitation of the \u201cpolitical\u201d must itself be viewed as a historical development, and one with gendered, classed and racialized dimensions. How do we locate a social movement ethnographically? What does ethnography as method teach us about social movements that we might not otherwise see? How do we proceed ethically, attending to questions of positionality, subjectivity, objectivity?  \\nThese conceptual discussions are presented in relation to ethnographic studies in Latin America, East Asia, North America and Eastern Europe, wherein students are also introduced to general disciplinary debates such as the challenges of multisited ethnography, cultural relativism, conceptualizing relations between the \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cglobal\u201d, digital ethnography, fieldwork methods and ethics, and practices of public anthropology, including writing to and for participants in social movements. The case studies are explored to emphasize the particular benefit of approaching \u201csocial movements\u201d with an anthropological lens onto everyday life; in the process, social theoretical concepts such as Marxism, anarchism, feminism and intersectionality are themselves productively decentered as cultural and historical objects.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nFrame research and questions within the context of the field\u2019s historic foundations  \\nApply and explain texts and concepts in social science theory. \\nAnalyze social science theory related to \'social movements\' as a history of ideas\\nUnderstand the disciplinary methodology of ethnography in relation to the topic.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nJune 14\\nIntroduction to Class\\nMODULE I : Social Movements in Theory\\nJune 21\\nPART I: Social Movements in Anthropological Perspective: What is Politics?  \\nNelson, Lise. 2003. \\"Decentering the Movement: Collective Action, Place, and the \'Sedimentation\' of Radical Political Discourses.\\" Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 21:559-581.\\nLagalisse, Erica. 2013. \\"Gossip as Direct Action.\\" In Contesting Publics: Feminism, Activism, Ethnography, edited by Sally and Lynne Phillips Cole.

They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\\n---\\nSample Topic Schedule\\n\\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\\n1.

Photography is present in a wide range of practices from avant-garde arts to mass media, from the convention of photo identification to the techniques of surveillance, from photojournalism to selfies and Instagram. Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded. With special attention to the intersection of photography and Vietnamese history, the course will also demonstrate how constellations of power - with regards to class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economy, and geopolitics - influence the practice, dissemination, and preservation of photography in Vietnam today.\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe course is designed to encourage students to: \\nAcquire a solid foundation on key theoreticians and artists who have engaged with the medium of photography. \\nAdopt an integrated range of flexible, research-led approaches to the studies of photographic history and theories. \\nStrengthen key skills in writing, reading, and public engagement necessary for higher-level courses in the Art and Media Studies major as well as related fields.","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 (BW)"},{"title":"Introduction to Video and Film Production","id":"ARTS104_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Trinh Dinh Le Minh","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdwfQAA/arts104fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Trinh Dinh Le Minh - Email: minh.trinh@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nPre-requisite: No\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThis video and film production course will introduce students to the basic elements of recording and combining image and sound using various kinds of digital equipment. We will also explore important technical and theoretical concepts associated with the moving image, such as editing, dialectic, representation, and protest. We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage. A core component of these assessments will be presentation and engagement on critique days.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:\\n1.

What does it mean to make theater today? What can we learn from a form of performance that has continuously strived to establish itself as a form of art throughout history? This course introduces Theater as a Practice: it provides an overview of the developmental history of theater while introducing students to its experimental forms. It encourages learning by juxtaposing conventional/historical ways of making theatrical works to contemporary interdisciplinary approaches, which engage visual art, philosophy, psychology, architecture, and new media, to ultimately create new collective experiences.

Instead of taking the form of a country survey, the course is thematically structured, with topics informed by artistic practices and concerns. As such, the course emphasizes close analysis of selected case studies and the works of artists who are considered among the most historically significant from the Asian region and its diasporas. This approach helps us understand contemporary art practice as intellectually conditioned, transnationally networked, and as something embedded in both local and global economic, cultural, and political developments. In addition, close examination of artworks will enable students to gain a deeper understanding of how these artists have navigated and continue to navigate the specificities of local histories, sensorial encounters with changing materials, technologies, and spaces, and the complexities of identity and belonging.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:\\nIdentify important contemporary artists in Asia and its diasporas, and situate their practices within national and transnational historical, cultural, and political contexts.\\nDemonstrate advanced skills in visual and textual literacy, demonstrable through analysis of sophisticated artworks and challenging texts in contemporary art criticism and scholarship.\\nEmploy relevant theoretical methods for interpreting contemporary artworks.\\nAcquire competency in scholarly research, effective oral presentation, and academic and curatorial writing required for continued graduate study and career pathways in industry professions.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nProvisional topics:\\n\xb7 \u201cContemporary Asian Art\u201d: Mapping the Field\\n\xb7 Video Art and Cybernetics\\n\xb7 Women Performance Artists from Japan\\n\xb7 Conceptualism in Southeast Asia: The Artist-Curator\\n\xb7 Pop and Politics in Late Socialist China\\n\xb7 Contemporary \u201cBuddhist\u201d Art?\\n\xb7 Relational Art and Social Engagement\\n\xb7 The Artist and the State in Singapore\\n\xb7 Art, Activism, and Islam in Indonesia\\n\xb7 Feminist Cyborgs / Posthuman Bodies\\n\xb7 Spectacle, Surveillance, and Art Superstars in China\\n\xb7 The Rise of \u201cContemporary Asian Art\u201d\\n\xb7 One Artist Talk\\n\xb7 One Field Trip\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading\\nWeekly Discussion Questions 10%\\nParticipation 10%\\nPresentation: Artwork Case Study 20%\\nBook Review 25% (1000-1250 words)\\nExhibition Proposal 30% (2000-2500 words)","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"12:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 2"},{"title":"Animation and Graphic Media in East Asia","id":"ARTS307_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Linda Zhang","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdwlQAA/arts307fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Dr. Linda C.

But how does animation \u201cpervade\u201d through different cultural, political, and economic contexts, even affecting expression, medium, and even technologies associated with animated forms? This course is structured by the idea of animation \u201cpervading\u201d throughout East Asia historically and also theoretically. To begin, we will start with theoretical discussions about the potential in the motion and form of animation. Simultaneously, we will discuss other forms of graphic media to question what pictures reveal about themselves, in terms of materiality, visuality, and language. During the semester, we will focus on different case studies of popular mass media and print cultures in the early 20th centuries in East Asia, such as wartime and postwar cel animation films, as well as adaptations of manga, manhua, and manhwa into print form, film, television, video games, and even fan culture. This course is also concerned with how serialization, translation, and adaptation affect the relationship between \u201coriginal\u201d and \u201ccopy.\u201d To study these questions, students will be asked to conduct a research presentation on East Asian comics and animation, write a critical review of one form of serialized animation or graphic media, and to write and design a final project exploring the theories and forms of moving-image and print culture that we have discussed during the semester.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nDemonstrate familiarity with animation directors, graphic writers and artists from China, Japan, and Korea\\nAnalyze films and literary texts, annotate with proficiency in filmic (visual, audio) and literary formal techniques; engaging with the field theorists in animation, literature, and graphic media\\nWrite, construct, and present reviews, rationales, and essays into a clear, original, and persuasive interpretive claims, in both oral and written formats\\nConduct and present interdisciplinary research across the arts, media, and literary disciplines\\nDesign graphic media and animation project synthesizing theoretical readings and case study research from the course\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1 (August 28-31) Introductions to the course \u2013 Pictures and the Animated Form\\nReadings:\\n- Eisenstein, Sergei.

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives\\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\\n---\\nCourse Materials:\\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas.

Answer: They all use auctions. Auctions are pervasive in our everyday lives. An auction does not necessarily consist of raising your hand to place a bid (or clicking on a button on eBay). There are many different types of auctions: descending auctions, second price auctions, reverse auctions, simultaneous ascending auctions, combinatorial auctions are just a few examples. Each auction format is adapted to a specific situation, and understanding what the key differences between various auction formats are and under which circumstances one should use a specific auction format will be one of the main purposes of this course. The starting point will consist of a reflection on what a market is and show that the very specific details about how demand and supply \u201cmeet\u201d can have a profound impact. The first half of the course will present the main auction formats and discuss their differences. The second half will focus on market mechanisms where there is no price, such medical resident match or school assignments.

The aim of this course is to develop an understanding of the basic concepts of robotics, focusing on the construction and programming of autonomous mobile robots. The course uses a studio-based approach that tightly combines instruction in theory with practical implementation. After a review of recent developments in robotics, students are introduced to fundamental concepts related to robot mechanics, kinematics, sensor systems, and motion control. They are then introduced to high-level concepts related to robot intelligence such as path planning, localization, and map building. Students are also taught essential concepts and skills of programming. Both the robotic concepts and programming skills are reinforced as they work in a supervised, hands-on, team-based project. In this project, students work in teams to apply the conceptual knowledge and skills that they have acquired to the task of building and programming a robot in hands-on sessions. Students develop their project in the framework of the engineering design process\u2014from the analysis of requirements and initial design to implementation and testing. The course concludes with a contest designed for the robots developed by students. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO):\\nAfter completing the course, students will be able to \\nCLO1: Understand fundamental concepts of intelligent robot systems that will help them better understand the design and development challenges in the field of robotics. \\nCLO2: Strengthen their engineering skills involved in the design, construction and control of robots. \\nCLO3: Deepen their grasp of programming concepts and their programming skills. \\nCLO4: Gain hands-on practice in building and programming an actual robot. \\nCLO5: Program an autonomous mobile robot to achieve challenging tasks. \\nCLO6: Work as a team to complete different learning tasks that include practical and team assignments \\nCLO7: Effectively communicate their results via professional report writing and presentation \\nCLO8: Sharpens their analytical, planning, presentation and teamwork skills  \\n\\nEngineering Major Learning Outcomes (MLO):\\nMLO1: Analytical thinking: Identify, formulate, analyze and decompose complex engineering problems along with available resources and authentic constraints using principles of mathematics, basic sciences and engineering sciences.

For example, they are the heart of a wide range of applications, from healthcare, smart homes and cities, transportation, and manufacturing. For example, a real-time embedded system that we use daily is smartphones, which feature multiple sensors like accelerometer, proximity, gyroscope, GPS position, and fingerprint. The systems must react to events in the external, often analog, environment within a predefined time limit and subject to hardware constraints, such as memory, computational capability, and power consumption. This imposes several challenges in acquiring and processing raw data from sensors to derive meaningful information and making suitable decisions to control the environment using actuators. This course introduces students with the fundamentals of designing, implementing, and analyzing real-time digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms in embedded systems, including required theory on key DSP concepts, the hardware used to sample and process the signals, and software development environments. In the first half of the course, structured laboratory assignments familiarize students with the hardware and software. In each lab, students will implement and evaluate multiple DSP algorithms for a given application such as sampling and digital filtering. Each algorithm can achieve a certain signal quality but a certain implementation cost, e.g., run-time complexity, which measures how fast the algorithm executes or runs on the input data to produce output data. As a critical thinking exercise, students will explore design tradeoffs in signal quality vs. run-time complexity. In the second half of the course, student groups will work on extensive real-time DSP projects of their choice to develop system-level design skills in a complex, unstructured problem context. Smartphones and STM32 high-performance microcontrollers would be the target real-time embedded systems for the labs and project.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will:\\n- Acquire an appreciation of the importance of real-time DSP for a broad class of real-world engineering applications;\\n- Learn and explain key concepts, ideas, and methods in a signal processing application area;\\n- Use multiple technical information resources, including library resources such as the research literature, the World Wide Web, and consultation with experts, to independently learn about advanced topics and to overcome technical obstacles;\\n- Identify and use a modern embedded DSP hardware system and development environment to develop, debug, refine, defend, implement, and test real-time digital signal processing algorithms for practical applications;\\n- Recognize, appreciate, and evaluate the tradeoffs necessary in algorithm design for real-time DSP implementation in embedded systems;\\n- Work jointly with peers in developing, debugging, and testing code and in completing laboratory assignments and term-projects;\\n- Complete and demonstrate a successful implementation of a digital signal processing design project in an embedded system; and\\n- Document a signal processing design project, including the engineering principles, procedure, implementation, and testing;\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek\\nDates\\nLecture\\nContent outline\\nLab assignments\\n1\\nAug. 28 - Sep. 03\\n1\\n- Course introduction\\n- Ground rule co-design\\n- Hardware and software introduction\\nLab #1: Overview of hardware and software tools\\n2\\nHardware implementation of sinusoidal generation algorithms\\n2\\nSep. 04 - Sep. 10\\n3\\nLab #2: Smartphone-based data acquisition processing\\n4\\n3\\nSep. 11 - Sep. 17\\n5\\nSignals and systems review and extension\\nLab #3: Sine wave generation\\n6\\n4\\nSep. 18 - Sep. 24\\n7\\n8\\nDigital filter design and hardware implementation: Overview\\n5\\nSep. 25 - Oct. 01\\n9\\nDigital filter design and hardware implementation: Finite Impulse Response (FIR)\\nLab #4: IMU pedometer\\n10\\n6\\nOct. 02 - Oct. 08\\n11\\nLab #5: Digital filters\\n12\\nDigital filter design and hardware implementation: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)\\n7\\nOct. 09 - Oct. 15\\n13\\n14\\n8\\nOct. 16 - Oct. 22\\n15\\nSampling and aliasing review and hardware implementation\\nLab #6: Data scrambler\\n16\\n9\\nOct. 23 - Oct. 29\\n-\\nMidterm break - no lectures\\nNo lab sections\\n10\\nOct. 30 - Nov. 05\\n17\\nMid-term exam\\nTerm-project proposal development and submission\\n18\\nAmplitude quantization\\n11\\nNov. 06 - Nov. 12\\n19\\nShort-time spectral analysis\\nLab #7: Spectrogram\\n20\\nCorrelation analysis\\n12\\nNov. 13 - Nov. 19\\n21\\nAudio DSP: Overview\\nLab #8: Guitar special effects\\n22\\nAudio DSP: Pitch modification\\n13\\nNov. 20 - Nov. 26\\n23\\nAudio DSP: Acoustic localization\\n-   Lab #9: Pitch detection\\n-   Project proposed design review\\n24\\n14\\nNov. 27 - Dec. 03\\n25\\nSpecial topics: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\\nLab #10: Pitch synthesis\\n26\\n15\\nDec. 04 - Dec. 10\\n27\\nSpecial topics: Image processing\\nTerm-project development and finalization\\n28\\nSpecial topics: Video Kalman filter\\n16\\nDec. 11 - Dec. 17\\n-\\nBack-up for lecture (if needed)\\n-\\nFinal Term-project presentation\\n17\\nDec. 18 - Dec. 24\\n-\\nBack-up for lecture or presentation (if needed)\\n\\nTextbooks:\\nR.

Despite its fundamental role in world history, it has received little attention until the 19th century, when the region came under Western rule and/or influence. Southeast Asia is a vast and complex region comprised of eleven independent states: Brunei, Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. It has one of the world\'s greatest ethnic, linguistic, religious, and cultural diversity. Throughout the semester, students will explore: Indianization, Sinicization; state formation and development; trade and circulation of ideas; Islamization, and Christianization; Asian colonialisms; Western colonialism and its legacies; nation-building; decolonization and birth of Southeast Asian nations; postcolonial regimes, \u201cAsian values\u201d, and \u201cdemocracy\u201d; politicization of the religions and radicalization; minority struggles, separatism, and autonomy. Finally, to get a more nuanced approach of the events, students will have the opportunity be introduced to vernacular sources and Southeast Asian perspectives on events that affected their societies and historical developments but had also a deep impact on the formation of Southeast Asia as we know it today.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:\\nWith a foundational grounding in history and theory, students will comprehend the broader processes of empire, political communities, transnationalism, interethnic association, politicized religions and competition.\\nStudents will apply these lessons to study other contexts in Vietnam, Southeast Asia, and the world.\\nThrough readings, discussions, and debates, students will learn to critically analyze primary and secondary sources, to address fundamental questions of historical change, and develop evidence-based argumentation.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nSelected readings:\\nCase, W. 2002.

Often that history is hotly contested. This gateway course introduces students to the dynamic field of history and explores not only how we study the past, but how historical narratives are created, used, and abused in the present. Every year students will explore a special theme as way to probe the origins of the profession, develop historical literacy, and challenge their assumptions about objectivity. They will also acquire the skills necessary to read and analyze primary and secondary sources, investigate complex and often sensitive historical questions, and critically evaluate arguments about past events presented in traditional print media, online spaces, and the public. This year Exploring the Past will investigate \u201cGlobal Saigon.\u201d By examining a diverse array of topics from food and architecture to religion and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, students will study the connections the world has made to Saigon and Saigon has made to the world. In so doing, students will better understand how to analyze the often controversial historical narratives that surround colonialism, capitalism, communism, and migration, as well as how Vietnam\u2019s past gets written\u2014and by whom.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nIntroduction: What is History?\\nThe Landscape of History and Thematic Module I [Locating Global Saigon]\\nHow to Read Like a Historian, Part I: Developing Historical Literacy\\nCan History Be Objective?\\nThematic Module II [Nam Ti\u1ebfn(s): Past and Present] (Media Review Due)\\nHow to Read Like a Historian, Part II: Primary and Secondary Sources\\nThematic Module III [Relgion: Temples, Mosques, and Cathedrals] and Thinking Historically Practicum\\nThe Uses and Abuses of History, Part I\\nThematic Module IV [Food: Colonial Diets and Anxiety]\\nThe Uses and Abuses of History, Part II\\nThematic Module V [Music: Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll in Southern Vietnam] (Object Histories Due)\\nObject History Presentations and Thematic Module VI [Saigon Overseas]\\nWho Owns the Past?

From outcasts and outlaws to religious fanatics, failed revolutionaries, ethnic minorities, \u201ccollaborators,\u201d and distant subjects from the far reaches of the French empire, students will interrogate the dynamics of colonialism by studying those who both resisted and assisted imperial rule \u201cfrom below.\u201d While rooted in history, this course will draw on research and conceptual tools from adjacent fields, including anthropology, gender studies, literature, and political science to ask what\u2014and who\u2014is revealed and obscured in the archives, works of literature, and official accounts used to study colonial Indochina. By focusing on the experiences of colonization rather than the institutional histories from which many are excluded, students will hone their social history skills and better understand how the past marginalization of people who ended up \u201closing side\u201d of history continues to affect social relations in contemporary Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. At the end of the course, students will research, curate, and present a digital archive project that highlights an individual or group from the colonial period who remain overlooked in contemporary histories of the region.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will:\\nUnderstand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos during the French colonial period.\\nAcquire and apply the methodologies of social history.\\nCompare and contrast how various historical phenomenon and ideologies (e.g. nationalism, colonialism, capitalism, communism) affected different social classes in colonial-era Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and trace how the legacies of these histories affect social relations in the present.\\nCritically analyze and evaluate primary and secondary sources to locate marginalized historical actors and address fundamental questions of historical social change in French Indochina.\\nCraft evidence-based argumentation through research and written assignments aimed at both academic and public audiences.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\n1.

Everything around us, our own bodies, all the things that we interact with, are a collection of chemicals. The study of chemistry thus allows us to explore and understand the matters and processes associated with nature and human life. General Chemistry is a gateway to this fascinating physical world, it offers the fundamental understanding of structures and properties of matters, from subatomic particles to macroscopic substances. It explains the rules of chemistry and physics that govern matters\u2019 behavior and interaction. What is the universe made of? Why do nuclear reactions both demand and release so much energy? Why do certain substances melt or boil at high or low temperatures? What makes a reaction go slower or faster and why do we even care? What is pH and how can our blood maintain stable pH? These are just a few of the questions we can answer in this course. As an essential course in most science education programs, General Chemistry serves as foundation for other courses in Chemistry, Biology, Materials Science, Environmental Sciences\u2026 For non-science major students, this course provides basic scientific understanding of our physical world.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of the course students will be able to:\\nExplain the structure of atoms, molecules, and their properties.\\nClassify chemical reactions based on changes in reactants and energy.\\nInterpret the three laws of thermodynamics in closed systems and in chemical reactions.\\nSolve chemical equilibrium problems, particularly related to pH and solubility.\\nDescribe simple reaction mechanisms and define rate equations.\\nAnalyze real world problems related to general chemistry through written communication.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nIn favor of opensource resources for learning, this course will use 2 online textbooks: \\n\u201cChemistry\u201d by Openstax College, available here: https://web.ung.edu/media/Chemistry2/Chemistry-LR.pdf \\n\u201cGeneral Chemistry: An atoms first approach\u201d by Josh Halpern, available here: https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Book%3A_General_Chemistry_-_An_Atoms_First_Approach_(Halpern)\\nWeek 1 - 5: Structure and bonding\\nWeek 6- 10: Thermodynamics and chemical reactions T\\nWeek 11- 14: Equilibrium\\nWeek 15 -16: Kinetics\\nFinal exam\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading\\nAttendance: 10%\\nSurveys: 5%, \\nOnline quizzes: 40%. \\nExams: 35%\\nWriting assignment: 10%.","categories":["E3"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"11:30:00","end_time":"13:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"11:30:00","end_time":"13:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 (BW)"},{"title":"Organismal Diversity and Evolution","id":"IS211_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Jesse Hollister","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdxaQAA/is211fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Jesse Hollister - E: jesse.hollister@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Sciences and Engineering (E3)\\nPre-requisite: CORE 104 Scientific Inquiry AND IS 101 Introductory Biology\\nShopping time: First two weeks, in-person\\n---\\nCourse Description: \\nAn introduction to the diversity of organisms on planet Earth, and the processes that generate and maintain their diversity.

Students will learn about the diversity and evolution of microorganisms, different kinds of communication, signaling, and interactions between microorganisms, as well as the feedback loops between microorganisms and the environments. For example: students will be able to answer the question why some microbes only exist in extreme environmental conditions, or why some microbes rely on other microbes or the host to proliferate, or whether we can use microorganisms as a forensic indicator or use microbial genetic materials as biomarkers to study environmental health. Students will explore the role of microorganisms in soil formation, water quality, food production, plant health, biogeochemical cycling as well as in human civilization, including medicine, industry, biotechnology, bioremediation, or even the exploration of the outer space. Furthermore, this course also emphasizes on a variety of hands-on traditional (i.e., culturing) and advanced laboratory techniques (i.e., molecular technique) to study microorganisms. The laboratory component of the course will also introduce students to some applications of microorganisms in daily life and in solving the world problems. Overall, the course will provide fundamental knowledge of environmental microbiology and guide the students to leverage this understanding to find creative solutions related to current environmental issues that threaten planetary and human health (i.e.: antibiotic resistance, pollution, and global warming).\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of the course, students will be able to:\\nDescribe the functional roles of microbial communities in diverse ecosystems;\\nCompare and evaluate microbial communities based on their DNA sequences;\\nPredict changes in microbial community structure according to changes in biotic and abiotic factors;\\nUnderstand how plants, soil, and human microbiomes are interconnected and how they can influence each other;\\nIntegrate their knowledge in environmental microbiology and ecosystems management to find out solutions for environmental issues.\\nPerform a wide variety of traditional and advanced laboratory techniques to study microorganisms and to apply microorganisms to solve the world socioeconomic and environmental problems\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus: To be updated and shared by the course instructor.\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading; Total 1,000 pts\\nAttendance 50 pts\\nReading Quiz 200 pts\\nLab Journal 200 pts\\nGroup Presentation 150 pts\\nMidterm Exam 200 pts\\nFinal Exam 200 pts","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Lab"},{"title":"Human Physiology","id":"IS306_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Nguyen Thi Hong Dung","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdxdQAA/is306fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Nguyen Thi Hong Dung - E: hongdung.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\\nPre-requisite: IS 101 Introductory Biology AND IS 212 Cell Biology\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nHuman Physiology is the study and science of human function with a \\"micro-to-macro\\" approach at the organization\'s cell, organ, tissue, and body system levels.

Humans have always been fascinated (and disturbed) by things at the borders of \u201cpolite\u201d society. Spooky, ominous, and dark themes have endured across time, even gaining momentum in the last ten years with television like The Haunting at Hill House, novels like Mylene Dressler\u2019s The Last to See Us, or video games like the Devil May Cry series. This course will ask: why are we so fascinated by things that are spooky or supernatural? In what way is fear or dread a meaningful literary theme? And how has the gothic genre evolved to speak to us across different times and cultures? In this class, students will learn how to analyze literature, read critically, make claims about how texts work, and identify major themes and approaches. Students will also explore how texts work differently depending on their genre and form. Finally, the course will prompt students to question how literature articulates the values of the culture that produced it and to make connections between course materials and the world that surrounds them. Texts may include short stories by Angela Carter, Boleslaw Prus, and Edgar Allen Poe, novels by Henry James or Emily Bronte, and film or television by Jordan Peele and Guillermo del Toro.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\n1. Obtain a working knowledge of terms and approaches related to gothic literature, studies of fear and horror (e.g. grotesque, uncanny, abject, monstrosity, cultural studies, etc.) and how to apply them\\n2. Find balance between identifying the way that horror or fear in specific texts works to illuminate distinct cultural values and making comparative connections between texts produced in different cultures\\n3. Understand and apply close reading skills, with particular emphasis on connecting close reading to thematic analysis\\n4. Strengthen understanding of the formal elements of literature, with a particular emphasis on the techniques and structure of different genres\\n5. Strengthen argumentation and ability to provide evidence for claims both verbally and in writing\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nVarious short pieces early in the semester to teach genre, form, and close analysis, as outlined below:\\nUnit 1: The gothic, the grotesque, the uncanny, and the abject (4 weeks)\\nUnit 2: Holding the monster at bay\u2014hauntings, horrors, and the invading other (4 weeks)\\nUnit 3: The beast within: the depravity of the human soul (4 weeks)\\nUnit 4: Film analysis\u2014fear, horror, and monstrosity in specific cultural contexts (2-3 weeks)\\n---\\nPossible Assessments and Grading:\\n10% Reading Quizzes: assessed at random of the course of the semester, measures minimum reading comprehension and upkeep with work\\n20% Participation\\n10% Scribe Assignment: assigned at random over the course of the semester, students will be responsible for notetaking and distilling the information from class and reading discussion into a document form that can be used as study materials, defines key terms, and highlights major issues\\n20% Explication Essay(2x10%): close reading focused, asks students to engage deeply and create an argument about a short excerpt of 40 lines or less\\n15% Create-Your-Own-Monster & Reflection: creative project where students select a culture and design a unique monster that responds to specific cultural fears, values, etc. Students are encouraged to explore their own home culture.

Second, how do those representations differ across cultures and geographies? What does that tell us about human relationships to the world around us, as well as how heterogenous those relationships can be? This course will feature materials from what we might know today as \u201cthe global south\u201d (though not exclusively) to initiate conversations about how power, oppression, and consumption affect those earlier mentioned relationships and representations. We will not only learn to shift awareness to environmental concerns in literature but also learn theories and approaches to facilitate that shift. Broadly speaking this course introduces students to the methodology of ecocriticism, or the study of ecoliterature, but also to intersectionality, where race, class, gender, and place can affect one another and manifest in literature.

Special attention will be paid to defining traits and aesthetic of modernism in American literature. In addition, we will spend one-third of the semester studying the literature of the Harlem Renaissance. We will situate modern American literature within its specific socio-historical, cultural, and philosophical contexts. The selected readings focus on (1) how the Great Depression had a significant impact on American writers, (2) the problem of race in literature of the Harlem Renaissance, (3) women writers and their imaginative explorations of gender politics, (4) the gap between the hopefulness of the Reconstruction era and the traditionalism of what became known as the Southern renaissance, (5) how modern authors critique American provincial life, and (6) poetry and the search for form. Besides the selected short stories, poetry, and drama, you will read three novels: Langston Hughes\'s Not Without Laughter, Hemingway\'s The Sun Also Rises, and Edith Wharton\'s Ethan Frome.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After completing this course, students will be able to:\\nunderstand the historical, cultural, critical, and especially literary contexts of modern American literature, particularly during the interwar years 1914-1945\\nunderstand the major characteristics of American literary modernism and will be able to utilize those characteristics to analyze individual works of American literature in both literary and artistic forms.\\nengage thoughtfully and openly with a range of critical and theoretical perspectives on literary and cultural (and even controversial) issues, including the ability to state clearly the assumptions and premises of their own positions.\\nperform a literary close reading (both in class discussions, exercises, and assignments and in out-of-class writing assignments), demonstrating an ability to read and interpret literary works by thoughtfully integrating quoted passages into larger argumentative claims\\nwrite clear, grammatically correct, and rhetorically effective papers of literary analysis and interpretation (and perhaps even of critique), driven by a thesis and sustained by logic, textual and historical evidence, and a reasoned, ordered, and coherent argument.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nRequired textbooks:\\n1/ The Norton Anthology of American Literature, 1914-1945 (9th edition)\\n2/ Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises\\n3/ Langston Hughes, Not Without Laughter\\n4/ Edith Wharton, Ethan Frome\\nReading schedule:\\nWEEK 1:\\nSession 1: Syllabus & Introduction\\nSession 2: Edwin A.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language.

We are spending more time and effort in borderless cyberspace but at the same time, dealing with issues in the multicultural physical space. Technology and society co-evolve, thus making it essential to understand both in order to grasp the best opportunities and also prepare for the upcoming challenges that arise from the ever increasing integration of technologies into our societies. While a discussion takes place among experts and in academia, foremost in the domain of Science and Technology Studies (STS), on the current and future social, economic, moral, legal, and political consequences, to the broader public, including early-stage students, these technologies and their implications can often remain abstract terms. One might have heard about IT, AI, big data, the Internet of Things, deep learning, or blockchain. Buzz words that we find frequently used in the international media. This course discusses these technologies, and systemically, in various sections throughout the semester, examines the social, ethical, moral, economic, political, and legal implications these technologies have and will have on societies globally. It will address critical societal challenges such as privacy, cybersecurity, misinformation, governance and politics in the digital age, media, business stability, ethics and morals in the digital age, and new modes of the workforce, among others. We will also look at internet governance as well as privacy protection rules in a global context for better understanding of global trends in building healthy relations between technology and society. Throughout, the course aims to educate students to think critically about the approaches and possible solutions to the challenges in the physical and virtual domain. The course serves as an introduction to these technologies and a moderate foray into Science and Technology Studies\' academic discipline. It should enable students to understand better the underlying technologies and the value of Science and Technology Studies (STS) while hopefully further arising interest in these subjects and into this academic discipline \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nGiven an introduction into the field of Science and Technology Studies.\\nProvide an understanding how academic profession studies technologies and technological changes.\\nUnderstand the complex relationship between technology, sciences and society\\nAnalyze important trends about the way and nature of current and emerging technological developments, allowing to gain an understanding on how technologies could develop further.\\nUnderstand the complex relationships between technology, sciences, innovation, economic, political and social dynamics, and societies\\nUnderstand how and why technology advancements have modified the physical and virtual environment of human societies\\nEnhance students\u2019 ability to approach complex problems critically, systematically and innovatory\\nDevelop students\u2019 capacity to position themselves in the emerging civilization age \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1: Class Introduction.

Its primary objective is to familiarize students with fundamental concepts and key issues related to law, politics, and society in Vietnam following the country\'s reunification. The course begins by examining the evolving structure of law and politics in Vietnam after the Vietnam War, along with the philosophical foundations, societal conflicts and political visions of the unified country. It then delves into the significant legal and political challenges faced by Vietnam during the final years of the Cold War, as well as the groundwork laid for the Doi Moi reform era. Additionally, the course investigates how classical Marxism was adapted by Vietnamese legal and political philosophers to address global changes.\\nSubsequently, the course focuses on the legal reforms of the early 1990s, led by the Vietnam Communist Party, and the development of concepts such as socialist rule of law and socialist market economy. It explores how laws were formulated as tools of governance. The course further explores Vietnam\'s legal system in the context of the country\'s global integration campaign. Specific attention is given to key legal areas such as criminal law, labor law, civil law, economic law, digital law, human rights and constitutional law. Finally, the course examines Vietnam\'s renewed interest in establishing a socialist rule of law and considers the implications of contemporary global issues on the country.\\nThroughout the course, students will be exposed to historical and comparative methods in examining the law, politics and society of Vietnam. This will raise important questions about the potential advantages and limitations of using law as an analytical category in cross-cultural studies. The course will explore the dynamics that arise when \\"Eastern\\" and \\"Western\\" legal cultures interact with each other, especially in the context of a Party State. It will also consider the significance for Marxist theorists of engaging with Western legal concepts such as contract law, company law, capital market, and human rights. Students will investigate the relationship between law, capitalism, and socialism, as well as how law shapes global political and socio-economic relations. The course will analyze how law both produces and constrains subjects and identities\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to:\\nExplain how historical and cultural forces underlay contemporary legal discourse in Vietnam.\\nIdentity and analyze key issues facing Vietnamese law today\\nApply social and legal theory to analyze law both in Vietnam and abroad.\\nDiscuss the role of law in everyday life in contemporary Vietnam.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nRequired Text: Mark Sidel, Law and Society in Vietnam: The Transition from Socialism in Comparative Perspective (Cambridge Studies in Law and Society), Cambridge University Press (March 17, 2008)\\nChanges.

Under such circumstances it is nearly impossible to foresee further international developments without understanding how China approaches the world and what shapes its behavior. How can we make sense of how China makes its foreign policy at a time of uncertainty and transformation? What is, and should be, China\u2019s role and interest in addressing myriad complex global challenges? This course will explore the major issues in Chinese foreign policymaking with a particular focus on Vietnam and the U.S. as case studies. \\nThis course provides a comprehensive understanding of Chinese foreign policy. It will begin by examining the role of history, national identity, ideology, national interests in Chinese policymaking, and then explore the major institutions and actors in the Chinese foreign policymaking system. We will then examine in-depth Chinese policy towards Vietnam and the U.S. to see how Chinese foreign policymaking works. The course will also look at the historical context behind Chinese decision-making, present-day issues, and future challenges. \\nIn this way the students are expected to grasp certain background knowledge of Chinese history, political system and foreign policy process, as well as sufficient understanding of the key concepts and developments in international relations. They will both become familiar with Chinese foreign relations and enhance their conceptual understanding of the logics behind it.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: The students are expected to:\\nUnderstand/Recognize the domestic social, economic and political forces which shaped the current Chinese foreign policy (hereinafter CFP)\\nEnhance/Perform the students\u2019 understanding of contemporary CFP and its historical development through the study of China\u2019s relations with Vietnam, the US and regions of the world, and also the key issues in these relations.\\nCommunicate with structured knowledge of CFP and enable them to independently explain CFP decisions by presenting the key principles and factors shaping CFP.\\nFormulate and conduct analytical skills; facilitate their ability to formulate and clearly express arguments in writing and oral presentations.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1.

Drawing on theories from gender studies, feminist theories, media theories (including behavioural psychology and media), students will learn how to critically analyse and evaluate the relationship between gender and media using quantitative research approaches.\\nThe course emphasises the practical aspects of conducting quantitative research in gender and media studies. Students will be introduced to the process of formulating research questions that address gender-related issues in the media (including the positionality of Vietnamese women in traditional and broker-arranged marriages, Vietnamese brides and East Asian husbands in social and popular media, etc.), and they will learn how to select appropriate quantitative methods for data collection and analysis. They will also explore different techniques for collecting quantitative data, such as surveys, content analysis, and experiments, while considering ethical considerations in research.\\nApart from acquiring essential skills in data analysis and interpreting quantitative finding, students will also learn how to report research results effectively, both in written form and through visual representations. Throughout the course, students will engage in hands-on activities, including designing and conducting their own small-to-medium scale quantitative research project that investigates gender and media phenomena in the Vietnamese context.\\nBy the end of the course, students will possess a solid foundation in applying quantitative methods to explore gender and media issues in Vietnam. They will be well-informed about the relevant theories from media and gender studies, allowing them to critically analyse the influence of media on gender perceptions, stereotypes, and representations. Additionally, students will have practical skills in formulating research questions, selecting appropriate quantitative methods, collecting and analysing data, as well as reporting research results effectively.\\nNote: This course assumes a basic understanding of media studies and gender studies.

It will provide you with an introduction to Vietnamese Studies, which is both an interdisciplinary field and a transnational community of scholars and students in Vietnam and across the world. The course incorporates scholarship and methods from multiple disciplines, with particular attention to History, Environmental Studies, and Literary and Film Studies. These interdisciplinary investigations will be linked by our focus on the theme of development in Vietnam. In this course, we will analyze development historically and contextually; we will also seek to understand it not simply as an economic process, but also as a political, social, and ideological category.\\nThis course inaugurates a new collaborative learning partnership between Dartmouth College, a member of the Ivy League founded in 1769, and Fulbright University Vietnam, a liberal arts university established in Ho Chi Minh City in 2016. Throughout the fall 2020 term, you and your Fulbright classmates will be interacting and co-learning with a group of American students enrolled in a similar course at Dartmouth. Our two courses will function as a single \u201cconnected course,\u201d co-designed and co-taught by Dartmouth and Fulbright faculty, and using a common syllabus.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents who successfully complete this course will:\\nGain an introductory knowledge of the field of Vietnamese Studies and the major theoretical and practical issues in the field;\\nConstruct a working definition of the meaning of development, informed by the critical perspectives developed by scholars in History, Environmental Studies, Literary and Film Studies, and other fields;\\nInvestigate key questions in the study of the recent history of development in Vietnam (especially since the 1980s);\\nInvestigate key questions in the study of environmental governance in contemporary Vietnam, especially as it relates to development;\\nInvestigate how development has been represented, celebrated, and critiqued in contemporary Vietnamese literature and film;\\nWork in a team composed of Dartmouth and Fulbright University students to design and execute a research project on some aspect of development in contemporary Vietnam;\\nCollaborate with their teammates to produce a short film that presents the main findings of their research project.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance: 5%\\nParticipation: 10%\\nOne-on-one interview assignment: 5%\\nOnline Field Journal: 10%\\nDartmouth-Fulbright Team Research Project: 60%\\nSummative Reflection paper: 10%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"12:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 2"},{"title":"Capstone Proposal Workshop","id":"VS305_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Nicolas Weber","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdyCQAQ/vs305fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Nicolas Weber - E: nicolas.weber@fulbright.edu.vn\\nPre-requisite: At least one course in Vietnam Studies, History, or Psychology.\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCross-listed with History (HIS) and Psychology (PSY) majors.\\n---\\nCourse Description and Learning Outcomes: The Capstone Proposal Workshop aims to develop students\u2019 independent research skills to prepare for the Capstone, write a proposal for their Capstone project as well as future research projects. Upon completion of this seminar, students will significantly improve their ability to:\\npose well-defined research questions.\\nidentify research topics and find relevant literature.\\ndevelop appropriate methodologies to address the research questions.\\nwrite up a research proposal.\\npresent ideas and research plan\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\n12 weekly meetings, 90 minutes each. There will be a wide range of topics, varied by different seminars. For example, the faculty in charge will prepare a list of questions/topics and have them introduced to students in the first session. Students will choose a suggested topic or their own tentative Capstone topic of interest to prepare a research proposal. While students are expected to work on their proposal independently, teamwork is also possible (need to be approved case-by-case).\\nThe seminar structure will be flexible and be at the discretion of the faculty running the sessions. One example of the spring seminar structure includes 2 parts.\\nPart 1 (6 meetings): In this part, students focus on finding resources and conducting a literature review. In the first two meetings, faculty present their own experience on how to approach a research topic, where and how to find resources, how to conduct and write up a thorough literature review (given a research question/topic). In the next four meetings, students take turns to present their findings on their topics and receive feedback. The outcome of this part is a complete literature review.\\nPart 2 (6 meetings): Sample research proposals will be carefully analyzed by faculty in the first two meetings: how to pose a research question, how to write an introduction, how to choose methodology, and make plans. The next two meetings will be organized as Q&A sessions. Students take turns talking about their methodologies and receive feedback/suggestions from faculty. In the last two meetings, students present their research proposals as a practice defense. The outcome of this part is a complete research proposal.\\n\\nSchedule:\\nWorkshop 1 Building the database\\nWorkshop 2 Preliminary literature review\\nWorkshop 3 Narrowing to topic\\nWorkshop 4 Summarizing an academic paper + Professional Communications\\nWorkshop 5 Lit review presentations\\nWorkshop 6 Lit review presentations\\nWorkshop 7 Lit review presentations\\nWorkshop 8 Writing up methodology\\nWorkshop 9 Research logistics\\nWorkshop 10 Final proposal presentations\\nWorkshop 11 Final proposal presentations\\nWorkshop 12 Final proposal presentation\\n---\\nPossible Assessments and Grading:\\nWritten Progress Reports (weekly throughout the Fall semester): 5%\\nIn-person or virtual check-in with course instructor/teaching fellow (arranged throughout the Fall semester): 15%\\nOral presentation of the research project: 30%\\nFinal proposal (at the end of the semester): 50%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"16:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 (BW)"},{"title":"Vietnamese migration","id":"VS306_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Le Phuong Linh","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdyDQAQ/vs306fall2023s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Le Phuong Linh - E: phuonglinh.le@fulbright.edu.vn\\nPre-requisite: One 200-level course in Vietnam Studies OR Social Studies major.\\nCross-listed with Social Studies (SS) major.\\nShopping time: First week, in-person\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nVietnamese Migration is an advanced-level course that examines the complex dynamics of migration from Vietnam, with a focus on the push and pull factors that have influenced Vietnamese migration patterns, both internally and externally. Students will be introduced to key concepts related to migration and will be encouraged to critically engage with the difficulties and challenges faced by individuals and communities (of Vietnamese origin) during their migration processes.\\nThe course content delves into the multifaceted nature of migration from Vietnam, with a particular focus on the gendered aspect of the phenomenon. Students will explore how gender plays a pivotal role in shaping experiences, motivations, and vulnerabilities of Vietnamese migrants, including the exclusive obstacles faced by female migrants due to the local norms and traditions. By analysing case studies, empirical research, academic literature, and multimedia resources, students will gain insight into the diverse reasons that compel Vietnamese individuals and families to migrate, including economic opportunities, political factors, family reunification, and social aspirations.\\nThroughout the course, students will be encouraged to think critically and engage in discussions on the ethical, social, and economic implications of migration. They will examine the impacts of migration on both the sending and receiving societies, considering issues such as (gendered) identity, cultural integration, social inequality, and human rights. Furthermore, students will explore the interplay between migration policies, social structures, and individual agency, fostering an understanding of the constantly involving dynamics that shape migration processes. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with a comprehensive understanding of Vietnamese migration and how it transforms modern Vietnam. They will be able to identify and analyse the key push and pull factors driving migration, critically evaluate the gendered dimensions of migration, and appreciate the broader implications of migration on individuals and societies. The course will prepare students to engage with contemporary debates and challenges related to migration and develop a heightened awareness of the current issues surrounding migration, especially in Vietnam and the Southeast Asia region.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will gain an understanding about the broader Vietnamese diaspora and its interactions with the homeland.\\nStudents will collect and critically examine a variety of primary and secondary sources to undertake a guided research project into Vietnamese migration.\\nStudents will communicate their research to a wider audience via video and written formats.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1: Introduction week\\nLearn about students\u2019 expectations of the course/course instructor and vice versa;\\nOverview: migration as a global phenomenon\\nIntroduction to Vietnamese Migration: Historical Context and Common Migration Patterns.\\nWeek 2: Key Concepts and Theoretical Frameworks in Migration Studies.\\nWeek 3: Push/Pull Factors: Economic and Political Motivations for Migrants from Vietnam and Opportunities and Attractions in Receiving Societies.\\nWeek 4: Family and Kinship Networks\u2019 Influence on Migration in Vietnam\\nPossible guest lecturer/speaker: Lan Anh Hoang.\\nWeek 5: Gendered Dimensions of Vietnamese Migration: Roles, Expectations, and Challenges.\\nWeek 6: Internal Migration within Vietnam: Rural-Urban Dynamics.\\nWeek 7: International Labor Migration: Vietnamese Workers Abroad\\nPros and cons for the local community and economy\\nPossible guest lecturer/speaker: Isabelle Cheng.\\nWeek 8: Human Trafficking and Smuggling in Vietnam and the Southeast Asia Region.\\nWeek 9 \u2013 Mid-term Break.\\nWeek 10: Forced Migration and Refugee Movements from Vietnam.\\nWeek 11: Vietnamese Diaspora Communities: Identity, Transnationalism, and Cultural Preservation.\\nWeek 12: Remittances and Development: Economic Impacts of Vietnamese Migration.\\nWeek 13: Social Integration and Cultural Adaptation of Vietnamese Migrants\\nIn Southeast Asia vs. Western Countries.\\nWeek 14 \u2013 27/11-01/12: Social Exclusion, Discrimination, and the Marginalisation of (Returned) Vietnamese Migrants.\\nWeek 15 \u2013 04-08/12: Migration Policies and Governance: Implications for Vietnamese Migrants\\nEmerging Trends and Future Directions in Vietnamese Migration Studies\\nUrban to Rural trend: is it sustainable?\\nMigration TO Vietnam: what are the pull factors?\\n\\nKey readings:\\nScholten, P.
