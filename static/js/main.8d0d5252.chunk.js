We will investigate how the discipline of art history began to take shape as early as the 17th century, and focus on the key theoretical investigations and methods of interpretation that have informed the study of art through the present. Such approaches include connoisseurship, iconography, semiology, Marxism, feminism, poststructuralism, visual culture, and postcolonial studies. Important questions that will surface throughout our discussions include the relationship of artistic form to context, the very notion of art as history, and the possibilities and challenges of a truly \'global\' art history. Assessments and activities will encourage students to think of theory as method, and to apply these lenses of interpretation to objects and images of study.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nAfter finishing this course, students should be able to:\\nIdentify key authors and texts associated with art historical methodologies and theoretical frameworks\\nDemonstrate visual and theoretical literacy relevant to the study of art and art history\\nCritically assess how historical approaches to interpreting art can be situated interdisciplinarily\\nApply art historical methods through spoken and written argumentation\\nDemonstrate knowledge and skills applicable to art historical scholarship, curatorship, and other industry and academic fields\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nParticipation - 15%\\nWeekly pr\xe9cis with dated annotations (6 in total, approx. 300-400 words each) \u2013 25%\\nGroup Presentation \u2013 20%\\nFinal paper proposal, preliminary bibliography, and presentation \u2013 10%\\nFinal paper (approx. 1000 words) \u2013 30%","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"}],"location":"Classroom 4 & 5"},{"title":"Video and Film Production","id":"ARTS104_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Aaron Toronto","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002TF5duQAD/arts104fall2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Aaron Toronto - E:\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nPre-requisite: No\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThis video and film production course will introduce students to the basic elements of recording and combining image and sound using various kinds of digital equipment.

After the past few years upheaval and distress, this suggestion may no longer seem very far-fetched. Concerns about social, ecological, and technological crises, when thematized, however, are often relegated to genres of fiction suggesting a certain departure from reality. If our circumstances have become similar to a \u201cwork of science fiction,\u201d then we must also take a closer look at how works of not just science fiction, but also horror and fantasy, rely on the boundaries between familiar and unfamiliar\u2014enabling us to imagine and cognitively process difficult questions that at first, seem uncanny and estranged from our lives.\\nIn this course, we will examine film and media primarily from East Asia that are concerned with the gap between the familiar and the unfamiliar. Through different genres of media, we examine how bodies, spaces, and even the Earth itself\u2014that we take for granted as familiar entities\u2014can become uncanny, strange, and alien. Our class discussion will take us from questions of environmental crisis and neo-imperialism in Bong Joon Ho\u2019s spin on the monster film genre in The Host, through the politics of the self and the boundaries between human and machine in Mamoru Oshii\u2019s Ghost in the Shell, and Huang Jianxin\u2019s Dislocation, to concerns about the end of the Anthropocene and human dominance over Earth in Chi Hui\u2019s The Rainforest and Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Nausicaa, Valley of the Wind. This course will introduce students to a wide range of East Asian language film and media materials in translation. No previous knowledge of the region is required.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nAnalyze films and texts, annotate with proficiency in filmic (visual, audio) and other formal techniques \\nWrite, construct, and present analyses into a clear, original, and persuasive interpretive claims, in both oral and written formats \\nConduct and present research in the art and media humanities \\nCreate original arguments that address the larger questions of the course \\nRevise and incorporate feedback and comments into projects and assignments from peers and instructors.\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n(topics to be reduced) \\n\\nWeek 1 \u2013 Introductions and the Uncanny \\nSigmund Freud, \u201cThe \u2018Uncanny\u2019\u201d (1919), 219-226, 238-252 \\nDuke University Writing Studio, \u201cWriting about Film\u201d \\n\\nWeek 2 \u2013 Heterotopias and the Monster \\nBong Joon Ho, The Host \\nTimothy Corrigan, Writing About Film. \u201cPreparing to watch and preparing to write\u201d and \u201cApproaches to Writing about Film\u201d \\nHye Jean Chung - Chapter 4: Heterotopic Monstrosity: The Host and Godzilla, 105-129 \\n\\nWeek 3 \u2013 The science fiction cityscape \\nHao Jingfang, \u201cFolding Beijing\u201d \\nMarilyn Fabe, \u201cFilm Glossary\u201d \\nLiao, Wang. \\"The Alienation of Spaces in Future China: The Case of Hao Jingfang\'s Folding Beijing.\\" Comparative Literature Studies, Vol. 57, No. 4, 2020, 686-701.  \\n\\nWeek 4 \u2013 Science fiction and Lost love \\nWong Kar Wai, 2046 \\nDonna Haraway: \u201cA Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s,\u201d 1-37 \\n\\nWeek 5 - Politics of the Cyborg self \\nMamoru Oshii, Ghost in the Shell (1995) \\nChristopher Bolton, Chapter 3 Puppet Voices, Cyborg Souls; pg 95-128 \\n\\nWeek 6 \u2013 Science fiction and Trauma \\nJang Joon-hwan, Save the Green Planet \\nChu, Seo-young.

Suggested writers and art theorists might include Hal Foster, Rosalind Krauss, Claire Bishop, Walter Mignolo, Jacques Derrida, Thierry deDuve, and Geeta Kapur. Students will propose their choices of texts and develop a reading list in collaboration with their classmates and the instructor, and each week will be devoted to carefully thinking through the language, ideas, and images generated by the texts. Emphasis will be placed on slowing and breaking down the ways in which we search for and produce meaning in reading and through our own writing. Students will create an individualized assessment plan in consultation with the instructor, and while discussion and participation will be substantially weighted, other assessments may take the form of annotated bibliographies, long and short essay forms, creative and curatorial writing, in addition to the realization of artistic works.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will develop strategies for reading, understanding, explaining, and responding to challenging theoretical texts\\nStudents will gain familiarity with important writers and theorists in art history and related disciplines\\nStudents will deepen their understanding of theoretical approaches such as deconstruction, postformalism, and related poststructuralist methodologies\\nStudents will demonstrate their understanding and application of theoretical method through written and creative assessments\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAssessments will include presentations and other forms of substantial writing and artistic production, the parameters of which will be individually developed in consultation with the instructor.\\nThis project will be graded in Letter grade.","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Meeting room 1"},{"title":"Capstone I","id":"ARTS401_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Offering Status","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002TIcjMQAT/arts401fall2022s01","description":"This course is for the students who got Major Advisor\'s approval for the Capstone project in Year 4 at Fulbright.\\nPlease contact your Major Advisor to plan and complete your capstone.","categories":[],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Global Humanities and Social Change","id":"CORE101_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Tobias Burgers","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002TF5e0QAD/core101fall2022s01","description":"Faculty: Tobias Burgers - E: tobias.burgers@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Core\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course examines key moments in the global history of thought through the lens of textual analysis.

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives\\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\\n---\\nCourse Materials:\\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas.

This introductory course is divided into two parts. The first part of this course focuses on philanthropic giving while the second part focuses on philanthropic effectiveness. Key questions to be examined in part one include why and how people give (time, money, skills, etc.). Key questions to be examined in part two include why and how to evaluate philanthropic effectiveness. In addition, students will be invited to consider how government policy influences giving and effectiveness. As students explore these questions, they will draw upon academic scholarship from multiple disciplines ranging from psychology and economics to ethics and philosophy. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nMajor learning outcomes:\\nApply economic analysis to everyday problems, evaluate policies and the data supporting them, investigate arguments, and analyze the world in terms of trade-offs and incentives. \\nCollect, interpret, and manipulate quantitative data to address real-world problems. \\nDisplay a command of existing knowledge by explaining key economic theories and concepts and describing how they can be used. \\nWork in and lead teams; ensure students can navigate diverse audiences and environments. \\nCreate new knowledge by identifying and formulating a question on some economic issue that will facilitate its investigation. \\nPrepare for masters or doctoral programs in Economics or related disciplines such as Public Policy and Data Science at top-tier international program\\nCourse learning outcomes:\\nBy the end of this course students will be able to: \\nUnderstand the role of philanthropy in society\\nExplain different reasons for giving. \\nIdentify desirable philanthropic outcomes for different stakeholders. \\nEvaluate and critique different methods used to measure social change. \\nDesign a philanthropic strategy for an organization. \\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n\\nWeek \\nTopic \\nReadings \\n1 \\nWhat is philanthropy? \\nSchein (2009) \u201cWhat is help?\u201d Chapter 1 in Helping: How to offer, give, and receive help, Understanding effective dynamics in one-to-one, group, and organizational relationships \\n2 \\nPerspectives on philanthropy \\nGiridharadas, Anand.

This course is reading- and writing-intensive and is organized as a series of discussions. This course focuses on two main aspects: (i) the analysis of economic inequalities and (ii) the interaction between inequality and economic development. It will address the following questions from a theoretical perspective and/or an empirical perspective: \\n1. How does inequality evolve over time, and how does the evolution of inequality couple with the dynamics of economic development? \\n2. What are the determinants of inequality, and which theories can account for the level of economic inequalities and its dynamics?  \\n3. Which public policies can reduce inequality and foster equitable growth?  \\n4. How quickly does the level of inequality respond to a change in a public policy? \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nMajor Learning Outcomes (MLO): Students in the Economics major will:  \\nMLO1: Apply economic analysis to everyday problems, evaluate policies and the data supporting them, investigate arguments, and analyze the world in terms of trade-offs and incentives.\\nMLO2: Collect, interpret, and manipulate quantitative data to address real-world problems.\\nMLO3: Display a command of existing knowledge by explaining key economic theories and concepts and describing how they can be used.\\nMLO4: Work in and lead teams; ensure students can navigate diverse audiences and environments.\\nMLO5: Create new knowledge by identifying and formulating a question on some economic issue that will facilitate its investigation.\\nMLO6: Prepare for masters or doctoral programs in Economics or related disciplines such as Public Policy and Data Science at top-tier international programs.\\n\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO): Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nCLO1: Explain the key concepts of inequality such as the Gini coefficient, the coefficient of variation, the Pareto measure of inequality, the top income/wealth shares, and so on.  \\nCLO2: Develop a critical approach of the data and methods used to measure inequality.\\nCLO3: Analyze the determinants and consequences of economic inequality using appropriate theoretical models and empirical data.\\nCLO4: Evaluate the effectiveness of public policies used to combat inequality.  \\nCLO5: Propose appropriate policies to deal with inequality and promote equitable growth.\\nCLO6: Conduct independent research, especially on economic inequality.  \\nCLO7: Collaborate and work in teams effectively.\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\nPART 1: CORE CONCEPTS \\nWeek 1: Introduction \\nReadings:  \\nBenjamin, D., Brandt, L., & McCaig, B.

Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age? How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. The aim of this course is to understand the big forces that pull the world\u2019s parts together as well as those that drive them apart. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects you to students elsewhere in the world.

Since then, it has become the leading global power, whose foreign policy not only disproportionately impacts other nations, but shapes the very structure of the international system. A grasp of American diplomatic history has become indispensable to anyone wishing to understand international politics from the beginning of the 20th century onwards.\\nThis course examines the evolution of American foreign policy through the 20th century, covering all the major events and debates of that time period, including the American decision to intervene in World War I and its consequences; the impact of America\u2019s isolationist foreign policy during the interwar years; the causes and consequences of World War II; the origins of the Cold War and American strategy; the creation and collapse of the American-led postwar economic system; American relations with allies and enemies in the Third World; and the United States in the post-Cold War World. We will also explore a range of macro-themes, including the role of ideology, race, religion, domestic politics, the institutional environment, and individual leaders in the making of American foreign policy.\\nThe goal of the course is to introduce students to the study of American foreign policy after 1898. Students will become familiar with important events, personalities, and theoretical perspectives. Students will be introduced to a range of opinions through secondary sources and trained to properly evaluate and use primary sources.

During this timespan, the wars in Vietnam evolved from anti-colonial struggle to superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As the struggle for Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states, citizens\u2019 movements, and other non-state actors whose interpretations and responses to the war were conditioned by a variety of competing local agendas.  \\nThis course will assess critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese, origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers commit so much to a small, distant country? What role did the larger Cold War play in shaping overseas powers\u2019 decision-making? What was impact of each party\u2019s respective domestic politics? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? How did it shape the politics and economy of the region? And what are the global legacies of the war?  \\nThe course will consider the Vietnam War as first and foremost a Vietnamese conflict, one which acquired increasingly global significance. In addition to exploring the domestic causes and dynamics of the Vietnam War, we will also consider the conflict - a seminal episode in the global Cold War - as a lens for analyzing a wide range of international events and trends. These include Empire and Decolonization; the Non-Aligned Movement; the Chinese Civil War; the American \u201cRed Scare\u201d; the Korean War; Development and Modernization Theory; the Sino-Soviet Split; China\u2019s Cultural Revolution; Detente; the rise of the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d; the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian Genocide; and the aftermaths, legacies, and interpretations of the conflict. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO): On completion of this module, students should be able to do the following (numbers of Major Learning Outcomes are attached in parentheses; see list of MLOs below): \\nCLO1: Identify the principal causes of the Vietnam War (MLO 1) \\nCLO2: Explore the factors prompting global powers to intervene, including the United States, France, the Soviet Union, South Korea, China, and Cambodia.

What does the world look like from the margins between states? The field of borderland studies puts those margins at the center of inquiry. In this course, we will learn how historically \u201cfuzzy\u201d borderlands in the Asia Pacific region became precisely bordered lands, or in some cases, disputed territories, in our contemporary world. We will also read from ethnographies and histories of everyday life to gain a deeper appreciation of life on the edges of the state. Readings will address a broad swathe of Asia with an emphasis on the borderlands between various states and the Qing empire as well as its successor states, including the PRC. Case studies will include Japanese-Ainu relations, Chinese migration to the Mekong delta, the making of Siam\u2019s modern borders, territorial disputes in Kashmir and Tibet, journeys through Mongolia, everyday life along the China-Russia border, and more. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nIn this course, students will develop \\nCritical thinking skills: We will challenge conventional frameworks for thinking about geographical space and human communities\u2014particularly, we will think critically about the framework of the neatly-bounded nation-state. \\nReasoning skills: we will think intensively about the best way to balance different kinds of evidence, including textual primary sources, maps, and participant observation data, while revising our image of the past and present.  \\nCultural knowledge: We will consider how life varies from one borderland to the next, and how life in borderlands may differ from life in the interior of a state\u2014particularly in the metropole. \\nEffective communication: Students will develop their writing and oral presentation skills with a historiographical paper, a research paper, and a final presentation. \\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n\\nWeek 1: What does a \u201cBorderland\u201d Look Like? \\nReadings: Elizabeth Kimball Kendall, A Wayfarer in China, ch. 6, \u201cTachienlu.\u201d \\n Unit 1: Frontiers and Borderlands \\n Week 2: Origins of the Field: Perspectives from North America \\nFrederick Jackson Turner (1920), The Frontier in American History, chapter 1. \\nJeremy Adelman and Stephen Aron (1999), \u201cFrom Borderlands to Borders: Empires, Nation-States, and the Peoples in Between in North American History.\u201d \\n Week 3: Comparative Asian Perspectives \\nReadings: Michiel Baud and Willem Van Schendel (1997), \u201cToward a Comparative History of Borderlands.\u201d \\nC.

It then moves into the emulation and modification of the Spanish model by other Atlantic imperial powers, notably Britain and France, and the general hardening of caste lines which occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We also discuss the racial, religious and civilizational categories used by early modern missionaries, most notably the Jesuits, not only with respect to black and indigenous people in the New World but also with respect to civilizations encountered outside the domain of traditional imperialism in South, East, and Southeast Asia. We then discuss how these categories contributed to the formation of \u201cscientific\u201d racism and how the latter, in turn, intersected with a variety of nineteenth-century European and North American imperial and educational projects. We close by reading excerpts from postcolonial theorists who grapple explicitly with the concept of race and its future.  \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\n1. Understanding the difference between a historical paper and an historiographical paper; learning to read multiple scholarly opinions and heuristics and rapidly identify the differences between or among them; learning to mine information on the educational background and historiographical school, etc., of contemporary and past scholars (e.g. this person is a member of the Cambridge school of intellectual history and therefore focuses on ideas in context, while a social historian will think about the experiences of past people, especially past subaltern people, and so on); writing fluently in the key of historiography. \\nThis contributes to the general goals of the major in terms of getting students to think historically, do their own research, read a wide variety of English-language sources critically, and so on. In general, historiographical writing requires less research than historical writing, but it is also more difficult because history undergraduates are trained to think of peer-reviewed journal articles and academic books as the \u201cword of God.\u201d Unlearning that and treating scholars as fallible historical people who, nonetheless, have done more serious research than any history undergraduate takes time and effort, and students will have to learn to read secondary sources much more closely and critically than they would otherwise do in order to construct an historiographical argument. They will also need to learn how to do creative research on the author\u2019s own biographies, for example finding CVs on university websites, reading acknowledgements pages, digging up juvenilia, and perhaps even interviewing the authors.  \\n\\n2. Understanding the degree to which European imperialism in its early modern/modern incarnation devolved on a) the introduction of religious-civilizational hierarchies unknown in the Middle Ages, which collapsed, to varying degrees, into racial-biological hierarchies b) the relaxation of prohibitions on unfree labor introduced during the Middle Ages. While imperialism, xenophobia, and exploitation were of course rife in the Middle Ages, as in any era, they did not take the racial and casteist forms which proliferated under Western rule c. 1500-1970, although other forms of casteism existed. Students will try to understand what made the ideological and material conditions for centuries of mass exploitation on an unprecedented scale possible. This course will also try to distinguish among the concepts of emperorhood, empire, and imperialism in a comparative context, focusing on the conditions which led to almost every Western European state declaring itself to be an empire during the early modern era, even states without a monarch.  \\nGrappling with the problem of modernity and/or Western hegemony is a subject which inevitably comes up in history courses which deal with material after about 1450. While other courses may encourage students to think about these problematics in order, for example, to construct a heuristic for understanding longue-dur\xe9e processes like capitalism or secularization, this course encourages students to confront the political, economic and ideological mechanisms of Western-led modernity head on.  \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeeks 1, 2, 3: Early Iberian Imperialism  \\nFrancisco N\xfa\xf1ez Muley, translated by Vincent Barletta.

Students will learn to read and write historiographically while, where appropriate, bringing in historical evidence (e.g. primary sources) in order to reinforce historiographical claims. The main skill emphasized here is learning how to sort through scholarship, identify points where there is substantial scholarly disagreement, and try to identify the sources of those disagreements. This involves learning to skim large amounts of scholarship in order to identify historiographical disputes at a glance, which is an advanced skil.  \\nFour introductions to in-class reading, presented and written with a partner, 300-500 words each, collectively 20% of grade. This assignment is intended to foster presentation skills and group work skills. In the case of readings which are older and/or notable among scholars (e.g. Black Skin, White Masks), students will be expected to work together to attain a basic literacy in the reception and legacy on the work presented on, as well as any controversies it may have generated. Again, this involves thinking critically about scholarship, learning about it as an artifact rather than accepting its contents as the \u201cword of God.\u201d  \\nClass participation, 20% of grade. Students will by the time of their arrival in this class have some familiarity with seminar-style discussion, but the goal here is to perfect it, to use questions from the professor as a jumping-off point for classwide discussion and not a simple exam question with a right or wrong answer. Students will be graded in part on their ability to engage with others\u2019 participation.  \\nFive interviews, collectively worth 10% of grade, 10 minutes each. Students will pair with a different partner from their partner in the introductions assignment for this assignment. Partners will create a 10-minute recorded interview in which they discuss what they thought were the high points of the readings and discussions of the past week of class. Interviews will be submitted the following Monday. These interviews are casual and are intended to improve: comfort with casual conversation in English; critical recollection and engagement with the material without instructor prompting; and level of engagement and attention in the class meetings leading up to the creation of an interview. Dead space is discouraged but recording many times to get a podcast-quality conversation is unnecessary.

But here we are! Biology as a field is advancing very rapidly and this course attempts to tackle some of the questions that are relevant to the current day and age by providing the knowledge and skills necessary. This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts and principles common to all living organisms and their interaction with the environment. Through immersive integrated lab, analysis of real datasets from scientists around the world and lecture experiences, this course introduces students to the scientific process and production of biological knowledge encompassing how scientists investigate the cellular, molecular, physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes that underlie life. Students in this course will consider the foundational questions about the existence of life on our planet and evaluate basic assumptions that enable scientists to describe and predict behaviors of cells, organisms, and ecosystems.

The tumultuous modern history of Vietnam (marked by three major wars, political division, unification, the destruction of one state, plus subsequent massive emigration of southern populations all over the world, as well asnormalization of international relations, and remarkable economic growth) has forced time and again, a deep and sometimes soul-wrenching reassessment of Vietnamese identity. Massive emigration over the 1970s and \u201880s following the Vietnam War, further complicated the question of identity, leading to large diaspora communities abroad with divergent values, aesthetics, and traditions. Throughout these upheavals, theproduction of short fiction, film, and tv have provided Vietnamese artists with a mirror of contemplation, a space for reckoning, and a canvas for the portrayal of alternative visions of Vietnamese life, society, and culture. Our class will begin with a range of short fiction produced at the end of the French period, in a time when Vietnamese intellectuals were struggling to imagine a new Vietnam free of colonial rule. We will then turn to depictions of the Vietnam war, and scrutinize both how foreign gazes represented Vietnam as well as how Vietnamese artists portrayed their own societies during this fraught time. Finally, we will turn to the postwar period, examining film, tv, and literature from both the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and contemporary diaspora communities, and ask how these artists imagine Vietnam and its future, in a time when the wars that tore apart the country are receding in memory.  \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will :\\nObtain a working knowledge of Vietnam in relation to its colonial and modern history\\nThink critically about narrative structure and their epistemological contributions across different media\\nMake important intercultural and interdisciplinary connections beyond the region of Southeast Asia.\\nProduce critical responses and essays in various formats (podcast, essay, video)\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n\\nWeek 1: Introduction & Narrative\\n-The Narrative Arc: \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d (https://thenarrativearc.org/plot)\\n-Suggested: George Johnson, NY Times: \u201cA Widening world of Hand-picked Truths\u201d\\n\\nWeek 2: Identity, History, and the Western Gaze\\n-Jamieson, Understanding Vietnam, \u201cPreface\u201d\\n-Barthes, \u201cAn Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative,\u201d pp. 237-260\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Oliver Stone (1986), Platoon\\n\\nWeek 3: The chasm between old and new\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Vi\u1ec7t Linh, M\xea Th\u1ea3o, Th\u1eddi vang b\xf3ng\\n-Fiction: V\u0169 Tr\u1ecdng Ph\u1ee5ng, \u201cS\u1ed1 \u0110\u1ecf\u201d (\u201cDumb Luck\u201d)\\n\\nWeek 4: Beyond existing boundaries\\nJamieson, Understanding Vietnam, \u201cBattle of the Novels\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Khoa, L\xe0ng V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i ng\xe0y \u1ea5y (\u201cOnce Upon a Time in V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i Village\u201d)\\n-Fiction: Nh\u1ea5t Linh: \u0110i T\xe2y (\u201cGoing to France\u201d)\\n\\nWeek 5: Colonial vestiges\\n-Saada, Empire\u2019s Children, \u201cIntroduction\u201d pp. 1-3\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Kim Lef\xe8vre, White M\xe9tisse (including introduction)\\n\\nWeek 6: Interculturality and ambivalence\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Kim Lef\xe8vre, White M\xe9tisse\\n\\nWeek 7: Hope and Disillusionment\\n- Dror, \u201cLove, Hatred, and Heroism: Socializing children in North Vietnam duringWartime, 1965-\\n75\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Fiction: L\xea Minh Khu\xea, \u201cNh\u1eefng ng\xf4i sao xa x\xf4i\u201d (\u201cDistant Stars\u201d), \u201cBi k\u1ecbch nh\u1ecf\u201d (\u201cSmall Tragedy\u201d)\\n\\nWeek 8: Watching the Autumns go by\\n- Dror, \u201cRaising Vietnamese: War and youth in the South in early 1970s\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n- Nh\xe3 Ca, Olga Dror: Mourning Headband for Hu\u1ebf (Selections)\\n- Film: H\xe0 Th\xfac C\u1ea7n, \u0110\xe2t Kh\u1ed5 (\u201cLand of Sorrows\u201d)\\n- The music of Tr\u1ecbnh C\xf4ng S\u01a1n\\n\\nWeek 9: A Hard Morning\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh, Bao gi\u1edd cho \u0111\u1ebfn th\xe1ng m\u01b0\u1eddi (\u201cWhen October Comes\u201d)\\n- Fiction: Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do\\n\\nWeek 10: The Silence of Defeat\\n- Kilbourne, Cinema, Memory, Modernity, Introduction\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Ham Tran, V\u01b0\u1ee3t s\xf3ng (\u201cJourney from the Fall\u201d)\\n-Fiction: Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do\\n\\nWeek 11: Art and relics of history\\n- Nguyen, Khai Tu, \u201cCai Luong and the Politics of North and South Vietnam\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n- Film: Leon L\xea, Song Lang\\n\\nWeek 12: Memory and Family history\\n- Fiction: Nguyen Phan Que Mai, The Mountains Sing\\n\\nWeek 13: Reimaginations\\n- Fiction: Nguyen Phan Que Mai, The Mountains Sing\\n\\nWeek 14: Diversification and Exploration\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Charlie Nguy\u1ec5n, Ch\xe0ng v\u1ee3 c\u1ee7a em (\u201cMy Mr. Wife\u201d)\\n-Film: Swann Dubus, Trong hay ngo\xe0i tay em (\u201cWith or Without Me\u201d)\\n\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nAttendance and participation\\nPresentation\\nCreative Reflection\\nMid-term paper\\nFinal project","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"}],"location":"Classroom 1"},{"title":"Pacific Voyages in Literature & Film","id":"LIT305_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Isadora Wagner","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002THKU2QAP/lit305fall2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Isadora Wagner - E: isadora.wagner@fulbright.edu.vn\\nOffice Hours: Office hours are available on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8:00 \u2013 9:30AM or by appointment.

The course moves chronologically through four periods and pairs key works in literature with cinematic adaptations. In Part I: Early Precursors (1400s-1700s), we consider epics, epistles, encyclopedic compendiums, first-person travelogues, and imaginative plays that precede the novel and shape its development through their tales of far-off peoples, lands, adventures, risks, and riches in the Pacific. Part II: The Novel studies the emergence and generic conventions of arguably two of the very earliest English novels\u2014Daniel Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels (1726)\u2014out of true-life tales of mutiny, shipwreck, island maroonage, cultural contact, and rescue. \\nBuilding on these themes, and noting the increasing imperialism and internationalism of the modern era, the third section considers two famous novels of the long nineteenth century\u2014Benito Cereno (1855), American author Herman Melville\u2019s short novel about a revolt on a slave ship in the Pacific off the coast of Chile, and Heart of Darkness (1899), English novelist Joseph Conrad\u2019s cautionary tale of colonialism, madness, and greed in the Dutch Congo, told from the viewpoint of Marlow, a Pacific sea captain, to an unnamed narrator on a boat. The last course section examines the role of the Pacific in the formation of early cinema and ongoing representations in literature and film today, including through the novels of Indian writer Amitav Ghosh (The Glass Palace, 2002), Hawaiian writer Kiana Davenport (House of Many Gods, 2007), and the films Apocalypse Now Redux (1979/2001), Amistad (1997), Castaway (2000), and Waikiki (2020). \\n\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of the course, students will be able to:\\nSuccessfully employ close reading and interpretive analysis skills when making evidence-based arguments about literary and filmic texts and other visual media. \\nApply the language and critical approaches of travel narratives, transnationalism, cultural studies, and literary studies when examining and discussing fictionalized, autobiographical, and factual portrayals of transpacific oceanic travel. \\nWork comparatively, critically, and deconstructively across genres, mediums, and geographies to account for patterns in portrayals of self, other, and nation when examining narratives of Pacific voyages.\\nCritically assess distinctions between different genres of cultural representations, including their limits, effects, and public reception; for example, between a short story and a graphic memoir or a documentary and a Hollywood film.\\nGain confidence in presenting original research and ideas in a public setting before a cohort of peers and faculty.\\n---\\nRequired Texts & Materials \u2013 The primary texts and films for this course are listed below.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \\nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \\nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2VW_ACdTlNzySiySyfPfOrgxQztprrzGxxL_2pfo5Q/edit?usp=sharing \\nSummary \\nUnit One: Foundational Questions \u2013 This unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. The primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. Each week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d This unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \\n Unit Two: The Human Experience \u2013 This unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. Each week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis. Different iterations of the class can select form a list of topics depending upon the instructor\u2019s preference. These topics include: Food, Sex, Death, Wealth, Nations, Power, Religion, Language, Law, Morality, Race. Readings include Margaret Wilson\u2019s Indulgence, Sidney Mintz\u2019s Sweetness and Power, Renato Rosaldo\u2019s Grief and the Headhunter\u2019s Rage, Marshall Sahlins\u2019 The Original Affluent Societies, Erik Harms\u2019s The Boss, Ernest Gellner\u2019s Nationalism, Benedict Anderson\u2019s Imagined Communities, Alice Goffman\u2019s \u2018On the Run\u2019.

We are spending more time and effort in borderless cyberspace but at the same time, dealing with issues in the multicultural physical space. Technology and society co-evolve, thus making it essential to understand both in order to grasp the best opportunities and also prepare for the upcoming challenges that arise from the ever increasing integration of technologies into our societies. While a discussion takes place among experts and in academia, foremost in the domain of Science and Technology Studies (STS), on the current and future social, economic, moral, legal, and political consequences, to the broader public, including early-stage students, these technologies and their implications can often remain abstract terms. One might have heard about IT, AI, big data, the Internet of Things, deep learning, or blockchain. Buzz words that we find frequently used in the international media. This course discusses these technologies, and systemically, in various sections throughout the semester, examines the social, ethical, moral, economic, political, and legal implications these technologies have and will have on societies globally. It will address critical societal challenges such as privacy, cybersecurity, misinformation, governance and politics in the digital age, media, business stability, ethics and morals in the digital age, and new modes of the workforce, among others. We will also look at internet governance as well as privacy protection rules in a global context for better understanding of global trends in building healthy relations between technology and society. Throughout, the course aims to educate students to think critically about the approaches and possible solutions to the challenges in the physical and virtual domain. The course serves as an introduction to these technologies and a moderate foray into Science and Technology Studies\' academic discipline. It should enable students to understand better the underlying technologies and the value of Science and Technology Studies (STS) while hopefully further arising interest in these subjects and into this academic discipline \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nGiven an introduction into the field of Science and Technology Studies.\\nProvide an understanding how academic profession studies technologies and technological changes.\\nUnderstand the complex relationship between technology, sciences and society\\nAnalyze important trends about the way and nature of current and emerging technological developments, allowing to gain an understanding on how technologies could develop further.\\nUnderstand the complex relationships between technology, sciences, innovation, economic, political and social dynamics, and societies\\nUnderstand how and why technology advancements have modified the physical and virtual environment of human societies\\nEnhance students\u2019 ability to approach complex problems critically, systematically and innovatory\\nDevelop students\u2019 capacity to position themselves in the emerging civilization age \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1: Class Introduction.

It seeks to examine different theoretical perspectives on social movements and meanwhile exposes students to empirical studies of movements across the world, in both democratic and non-democratic states, with an emphasis on Vietnam. The key questions we will examine include the following: When and why do social movements occur? How are movements organized? What do movement participants think and feel? How do social movements work? How do authorities respond to movements? Why do movements decline? What changes do movements bring about? How do Vietnamese social movements emerge and grow? Any challenges ahead for Vietnamese civil society?\\nThe course will be divided into two main parts. The first devoted to theories of social movements and the ways in which our understanding of social movements has changed over time. We will also examine mobilization to social movements and ask why some people come to participate while others do not as well as the tactics  and successes of various social movements. The second is reserved for discussion of Vietnam\'s nascent social movements. There will be also experiential learning format in the course through which students will have the chance to visit an NGO in Ho Chi Minh City.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nAt the end of this course, the student will be able to:\\nExplain the main theories and concepts used in class.\\nLearn the analytic tools necessary to examine and critically assess the role of social movements in our society.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned in class to better understand historical and modern social movement causes and campaigns.\\nDesign a research project that incorporates a clear hypothesis, literature review, and data analysis on the topic of social movements.\\nCritically analyze and evaluate published research.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned to analyze emerging civil society and social movements in Vietnam\\nDevelop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nCourse Readings: There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Canvas and consist of book chapters and journal articles that either discuss key theoretical paradigms used in the study of social movements and/or apply them to specific social movements.\\n\\nWeek 1: Introduction: Conceptualizing Social Movements\\nTilly, Charles.

The American War in Vietnam was a pivotal event of the 20th century. As time has passed and its survivors aged into late adulthood, we have reached a critical time to reflect upon that war\u2019s legacy and to engage in conversations with those who experienced and survived it. Their experiences hold insights into war\u2019s true toll, and the means to survive, recover, and reconcile in the wake of war. Unique to this course will be a transnational, multiplex consideration of war\u2019s legacies across diverse populations who experienced that war on \u201cmany sides,\u201d including Vietnamese and American participants in the fighting, protestors against the fighting, and a wide range of noncombatants who, despite being on the \u201cmargins\'\' of the fighting, nonetheless experienced war\u2019s toll. We will critically discuss how experiences of war and post-war migrations between countries constitute diasporic connections between Vietnam and America today. Through readings, films, guest lectures, and our own conversations, we will develop an appreciation of military veterans\u2019 and noncombatants\u2019 experiences \u2013 their memories of war, experiences of trauma, and sources of resilience. We will also consider the intergenerational and international connections \u2013 of suffering, resilience, and healing \u2013 that have arisen out of the American War in Vietnam. \\n\\nThis will be offered consecutively in two semesters, Fall 2022 & Spring 2023. The first semester is the time to provide students with multi perspective viewpoints of the war and its legacy, helping them to build a theoretical foundation for further research. The second semester will be conducted in a seminar style, as Fulbright-Utah students have figured out a research topic for their year-end final project. It will provide students with significant hands-on experience as it will lead them through various research phases, and show them how to present the outcomes of each phase effectively to an academic audience. Joint seminars will be conducted with the participation of all students from the two institutions.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\n-    Build a foundational knowledge of the geopolitical context, chronology, key figures, and events of the American War in Vietnam to situate that war\u2019s legacies. \\n-    Develop awareness of the linked cultures, social relations, and histories spanning the U.S. and Viet Nam that emerged through war, and an understanding of one another as populations whose lives are shaped and interconnected by war; \\n-   Comprehend how the American War in Vietnam, and other wars, have left enduring legacies upon critical sites of body, mind, culture, landscape, ecology, & society. This involves an appreciation of the many sides engaged in the war and the diaspora/transnational communities created by war.  \\n-    Engage in critical discussion and analysis of data, artifacts, and methodologies for describing and explaining war legacies, the strengths and shortcomings of these approaches, the experiences to which they give voice, and silence. \\n-    Through regular interaction and completion of shared assignments with team members at Fulbright University Vietnam and the University of Utah and, hone skills in cross-cultural awareness and communication, virtual collaboration, and team approaches to knowledge production. \\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule:\\nWeek 1  \\nReview syllabus \\nOverview of course - themes, structure, assessment, Fulbright-Utah Student Teaming Up. \\nThematic Focus: Diverse perspectives and diverse legacies of the American/Vietnam War \\n\\nReadings: \\nGeorge Katsiaficas, ed.

Based on the complexity of the theories such as intertextuality, translation studies, cultural studies, deconstruction, and reception theory, adaptation studies allow audiences to consider the film adaptations as independent films with respective creativities of filmmakers by their cinematic language. Because adaptation studies are interdisciplinary, this course will not only instruct students on how to read books and movies but also move beyond comparisons of sources and film adaptations. Adaptation studies can be considered as a methodology and a field. Therefore, the class will concentrate on communicating film adaptations with the texts they are adapting. During the term, students will practice analyzing several Asian film adaptations to illuminate adaptation studies and learn about the Asian cultural contexts surrounding the sources and their adaptations. The outstanding feature of the course is that students will understand what film adaptations show and do not show in comparison with their sources to break the notion of fidelity that limit the filmmakers\u2019 creativities in their adaptation process. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to meet some guest speakers who are Vietnamese filmmakers, such as Viet Linh, Phan Gia Nhat Linh, Vinh Son, Nguyen Vo Nghiem Minh to listen to their own experiences about adaptation. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to: \\nBe able to analyze a film adaptation and write critically about how film adaptation reflects filmmakers\u2019 point of view and the context. \\nInterpreting why the filmmaker changed and revised the source literary work. \\nUnderstanding the equal relationship between literature and cinema \\nPrepare and submit their essay in appropriate research. \\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule:\\n\\nWeek 1.

It will provide you with an introduction to Vietnamese Studies, which is both an interdisciplinary field and a transnational community of scholars and students in Vietnam and across the world. The course incorporates scholarship and methods from multiple disciplines, with particular attention to History, Environmental Studies, and Literary and Film Studies. These interdisciplinary investigations will be linked by our focus on the theme of development in Vietnam. In this course, we will analyze development historically and contextually; we will also seek to understand it not simply as an economic process, but also as a political, social, and ideological category.\\nThis course inaugurates a new collaborative learning partnership between Dartmouth College, a member of the Ivy League founded in 1769, and Fulbright University Vietnam, a liberal arts university established in Ho Chi Minh City in 2016. Throughout the fall 2020 term, you and your Fulbright classmates will be interacting and co-learning with a group of American students enrolled in a similar course at Dartmouth. Our two courses will function as a single \u201cconnected course,\u201d co-designed and co-taught by Dartmouth and Fulbright faculty, and using a common syllabus.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents who successfully complete this course will:\\nGain an introductory knowledge of the field of Vietnamese Studies and the major theoretical and practical issues in the field;\\nConstruct a working definition of the meaning of development, informed by the critical perspectives developed by scholars in History, Environmental Studies, Literary and Film Studies, and other fields;\\nInvestigate key questions in the study of the recent history of development in Vietnam (especially since the 1980s);\\nInvestigate key questions in the study of environmental governance in contemporary Vietnam, especially as it relates to development;\\nInvestigate how development has been represented, celebrated, and critiqued in contemporary Vietnamese literature and film;\\nWork in a team composed of Dartmouth and Fulbright University students to design and execute a research project on some aspect of development in contemporary Vietnam;\\nCollaborate with their teammates to produce a short film that presents the main findings of their research project.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance: 5%\\nParticipation: 10%\\nOne-on-one interview assignment: 5%\\nOnline Field Journal: 10%\\nDartmouth-Fulbright Team Research Project: 60%\\nSummative Reflection paper: 10%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"11:00:00"}],"location":"Classrooms 8&9"},{"title":"Contending Theories of International Relations: A Comprehensive View of Vietnam","id":"VS215_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Nguyen Thanh Trung","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002TF5f5QAD/vs215fall2022s01","description":"Faculty: Nguyen Thanh Trung - E: trung.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisite: Completed any 100-level History of Vietnam Studies courses\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n*Cross-listed with Social Studies (SS)\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThis course brings together International Relations theory and real-world Vietnamese foreign policy decisions and outcomes. The primary goal is to give students conceptual and critical tools to understand and analyze how theories of international relations, Vietnamese foreign policy outcomes, and current political events fit together. The course pays attention to the application of international relations theories to the problems we study, and also takes an interest in policy issues facing decision-makers in Vietnam as well as those facing decision-makers in other countries who deal with Vietnam. It is designed to develop students\u2019 capacity both to explain the foreign policy-making process in Vietnam, and to better understand the underlying patterns, logic, and implications of Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy in the world at large. \\nThe course is divided into three main topics. First, we will discuss International Relations theory that grounds Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy by examining the core international relations paradigms: realism, liberalism and social constructivism. It presents their historical origins, the evolution of their various branches (classical realism, neo-realism, neo-liberal institutionalism, etc.), and studies the contemporary application of the most important theories in the field. The second part of the class will examine the peculiar institutions and processes that guide foreign policy formation and implementation. Questions will revolve around who set the foreign policy agenda and what are the important institutions attempting to implement this agenda. Finally, the last third of the course will review some of the major elements and the more salient foreign policy challenges facing Vietnam since 1975. We seek to understand the security-based rationale of policy as well as other factors \u2013 institutional, ideological cultural, perceptual, and so on \u2013 that influence Vietnamese foreign policy. We also analyze decision-making processes that shape Vietnamese foreign policy, and Vietnam\u2019s relations with various countries and regions. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nExplain the major theories of international relations (hereinafter IR). \\nIdentify and describe the main similarities and differences among the major IR theories. \\nIdentify the leading authors in the IR field, as well as the theories, seminal works and key concepts they are associated with. \\nUnderstand the historical evolution of IR theory over time. \\nApply theoretical frameworks to understanding practical international relations issues. \\nAssess the behavior of actors in international politics in light of IR theories. \\nEnhance the students\u2019 understanding of contemporary Vietnamese foreign policy (hereinafter VFP) and its historical development through the study of Vietnam\u2019s relations with major countries and regions of the world, and also exploring the key issues in these relations. \\nProvide students with structured knowledge of VFP and enable them to independently explain VFP decisions by presenting the key principles and factors shaping VFP. \\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule:\\n\\nWeek 1: Course Introduction + What is Theory?  \\n- Stephen Walt. 2005. \u201cThe Relationship between Theory and Policy in International Relations.\u201d Annual Review of Political Science (8): 23-48.  \\n- Stephen Walt. 1998. \u201cOne World, Many Theories.\u201d Foreign Policy (Spring): 25-35.  \\n- Jack Snyder. 2004. \u201cOne World, Rival Theories.\u201d Foreign Policy.

They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\\n---\\nSample Topic Schedule\\n\\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\\n1.

Considering the idea of gender as performance, we will investigate\u2014in literature and film\u2014various performances of gender and question how they operate and function under oppressive and regulatory structures, what Butler calls a \u201cregime of sexuality.\u201d Focusing on literature, film, and other media produced from the East Asian context, we will also investigate gender and sexuality along with critical questions regarding power, performance, nationalism, and modernization. Many of the texts and moving-image media we will read and watch together will come from various genres of comedy, melodrama, musical, and speculative fiction. Many of them also feature coming-of-age narratives against the backdrop and violence of war, migration, or rapid urbanization and technological change. Together, we will practice close analysis and critical interpretation while reading essays and fiction by 20th and 21st century writers including Xiao Hong, Eileen Chang, Sang. Young Park, and Chi Ta-wei. We will practice formal analysis while screening and discussing films directed by Toshio Matsumoto, Wong Kar-wai, Park Chan-wook, and Sung Hsin-yin. This course introduces a wide-range of East Asian language materials in translation, and no previous knowledge of these languages are required.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will be able to:\\n1.

Beyond the popular understanding of curating as exhibition-making, this course will focus on what it means to curate as a critical and creative practice, and how curators conceive of stories and concepts within specific contexts. By reading texts, surveying key exhibitions, meeting guest speakers, visiting art spaces, and doing hands-on assignments and practical training, students will explore the traditional, artistic, and multidisciplinary possibilities of curating.\\nWe will learn about the influences, controversies, and thresholds of curatorship within different contexts, both historical and geographical, aesthetic and political. Saigon will serve as a local context of curating practice, as demonstrated through notable exhibitions from the modern postcolonial nation-building period of the late 1950s, and the post-Doi Moi period of the early 2000s to present.\\nThrough such case studies, we will analyze how exhibitions intersect with political representation and aesthetic developments, and investigate in more depth how one can curate between different contexts, such as from the urban to the rural; from the national to the regional to the international; and from a historical perspective to that of the future.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to:\\n1. Explain the concept of an art ecology\\n2. Demonstrate familiarity with current discourses of art, production, and exhibition-making in Saigon, Vietnam, and related regional and international contexts\\n3.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience.

Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

Accountability, school choice, charter schools, vouchers, privatization, merit pay for teachers, and school funding are just a few noteworthy examples. This course will explore how economists think about education in general as well as these specific policies and the underlying economic theories. We will address the following questions:\\n* What concepts, theories, perspectives, methods, and insights do economists bring to education policy debates, in both K-12 and higher education?\\n* How is economic thinking used to support and/or oppose specific educational policies? To what extent and in what ways does school choice \u201cincrease competition\u201d among schools? Is there a teacher shortage? If so, how might it be eliminated? How can schools attract high quality teachers? Do too many, or too few, students go on to college?\\n* What are the most important research studies conducted by economists of education? What have these contributed to our understanding of education? The readings are mostly drawn from the extensive literature on the U.S. education system, but many issues are universally relevant, and students are encouraged to make connections to their own experience and the Vietnamese education system.\\n---\\nCourse learning outcomes (CLOs): By the end of the course, the students should be able to:\\nCLO1: explain the key economic concepts and models relevant to education and describe their specific applications in educational issues\\nCLO2: explain how economists approach educational issues and how the economic approach to education differs from that of sociologists and other education researchers.\\nCLO3: understand the key policy issues in education and pose relevant questions whose answers help inform these issues\\nCLO4: evaluate the effectiveness of different education policies and propose appropriate policies to address educational issues.\\nCLO5: conduct independent research on educational issues.\\nCLO6: collaborate and work in teams effectively\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\nThere is no textbook for this course.

By definition, a signal is any observable change in quantity over space or time. It could help observers to obtain information about a phenomenon. In nature, signals can be actions done by organisms to alert other organisms or sounds or motions by animals to alert other animals of danger or food. Advances in technology have improved the capabilities of human beings to identify, analyze and even synthesize diverse information sources such as audio (speech, acoustics, music), image (photos, videos, multimedia, medical scans), medical signals (heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity) and remote sensing data (geophysical, sensing, radar). In principle, signals could be represented as data values or abstractly as mathematical expressions. A system converts or manipulate an input signal into an output signal. Examples of systems are face recognition, video streaming, cellular phones, and smart homes. In this course, students will learn to use mathematical theory and computer simulation to develop models, to analyze and to manipulate signals and systems that vary in continuous-time and discrete time. Specifically, the course covers representation of signals and systems, systems properties, conversion between continuous-time and discrete-time, Laplace, Fourier and z-transforms, transfer functions, frequency responses, convolution, stability, feedback and control systems. Students will gain hands-on experience on how to process various types of signals and to analyze and design systems by computer simulation using MATLAB or a similar software package.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes: After the course, students will be able to\\n1. Demonstrate understanding of the key concepts and mathematical representation models of signals and systems.\\n2. Strengthen their engineering skills involved in the design, analyze and simulation of systems process input signals in order to produce the desired outputs or to control the systems\u2019 behaviors.\\n3. Deepen their grasp of programming concepts and their programming skills.\\n4. Work effectively as a team to complete group assignments on practical signal processing applications.\\n5.

We will focus on extrapolating larger trends from interesting cultural vignettes and the lives of exceptional individuals, in contrast with the top-down and theory-heavy approach of my more advanced courses on early modern and Atlantic history.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\n1. Students will come to understand why we use the label \u201cAtlantic\u201d to describe the area in which the interactions and abuses fostered by the Spanish, Portuguese, British, French and Dutch Empires in the Americas were most highly concentrated. They will debate the utility and fittingness of this label.\\n2. Students will contextualize the lives of key figures in Atlantic history in larger trends and changes particular to the early modern Western world.\\n3. Students will, with the help of a partner, learn to use secondary sources to research historical figures not covered in class.\\n4.

During this timespan, the wars in Vietnam evolved from anti-colonial struggle to superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As the struggle for Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states, citizens\u2019 movements, and other non-state actors whose interpretations and responses to the war were conditioned by a variety of competing local agendas. This course will assess critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese, origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers commit so much to a small, distant country? What role did the larger Cold War play in shaping overseas powers\u2019 decision-making? What was impact of each party\u2019s respective domestic politics? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? How did it shape the politics and economy of the region? And what are the global legacies of the war?\\nThe course will consider the Vietnam War as first and foremost a Vietnamese conflict, one which acquired increasingly global significance. In addition to exploring the domestic causes and dynamics of the Vietnam War, we will also consider the conflict - a seminal episode in the global Cold War - as a lens for analyzing a wide range of international events and trends. These include Empire and Decolonization; the Non-Aligned Movement; the Chinese Civil War; the American \u201cRed Scare\u201d; the Korean War; Development and Modernization Theory; the Sino-Soviet Split; China\u2019s Cultural Revolution; Detente; the rise of the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d; the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian Genocide; and the aftermaths, legacies, and interpretations of the conflict.\\nThis course is a continuation of HIS208 The Global War Part I, taught during the Autumn semester.

Nonetheless, both the First Republic (1955-1963) and the Second Republic (1967-1975) had millions of supporters and were shaped by leaders and contributors who, whatever else, held sincere visions for what a constitutional, pluralistic Vietnam south of the Seventeenth Parallel might look like. This course provides a detailed assessment of the history of the Republic of Vietnam, beginning with its intellectual and political origins during the mid-colonial period through to its fraught manifestation and ultimate disintegration in the midst of a conflict that had evolved into a global Cold War struggle. In so doing we will examine the politics, economics, and culture of the Republic of Vietnam, addressing how and why the Republic came into being; the basis of Republican visions and ideology; and the nature and causes of the Republic\u2019s abrupt collapse from within in the fateful spring of 1975.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: On completion of this module, students should be able to:\\n\u2022 To engage with a range of theoretical and conceptual frameworks for understanding the history of the Republic of Vietnam\\n\u2022 To evaluate important methodological and historiographical trends relating to this time period.\\n\u2022 Analyse a range of relevant primary and secondary sources.\\n\u2022 Apply the skills acquired in formulating nuanced and sophisticated arguments supported by historical evidence.\\n\u2022 Apply transferable skills including effective written and oral communication, time management, and project management and completion, among others.\\n\u2022 Demonstrate critical thinking and analytical skill, and the ability to articulate complex ideas and interpretations verbally and in writing.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek One: Ideological Origins of Republicanism\\nReadings from Peter Zinoman, Christopher Goscha, Tuan Hoang, Agathe Larcher-Goscha\\n\\nWeek Two: The Colonial Bourgeoisie\\nReadings from Martina Nguyen, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Patricia Norland, Anthony Morreale\\n\\nWeek Three: Urban and Rural Vietnam\\nReadings from Hayden Cherry, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Gerard Sasges\\n\\nWeek Four: Print Media\\nReadings from Philippe Peycam, Shawn McHale, Hue-Tam Ho Tai\\n\\nWeek Five: The First Republic: Origins\\nReadings from Edward Miller, Jessica Chapman, Nguyen Phi-Van, Duy Lap Nguyen\\n\\nWeek Six: The First Republic: Development\\nReadings Edward Miller, Philip Catton, Geoff Stewart\\n\\nWeek Seven: Constitutionalism\\nReadings from Nu-Anh Tran, Edward Miller, Do Mau, Duong Thi Mai Elliott\\n\\nWeek Eight: Opposition and Protest\\nReadings from Edward Miller, Vu Van Mau, Arthur Dommen\\n\\nWeek Nine: A Turbulent Interregnum\\nReadings from Robert Topmiller, An Nguyen, Vo Long Trieu,\\n\\nWeek Ten: The Second Republic: Origins\\nReadings from Sean Fear, Jay Veith, Charles Joiner, Allan Goodman\\n\\nWeek Eleven: The Second Republic: Power and Protest\\nReadings from Sean Fear, An Nguyen, Nguyen Phi-Van, Tran Van Tuyen\\n\\nWeek Twelve: The Second Republic: Culture and Society\\nReadings from Olga Dror, Ngo Vinh Long, Jason Gibbs, John Schafer\\n\\nWeek Thirteen: The Second Republic: Collapse from Within?\\nReadings from Sean Fear, Dang Van Sung, Nguyen Be, Nha Ca\\n\\nWeek Fourteen: Aftermaths and Legacies\\nReadings from Nguyen Thien Y, Bui Diem, Cao Xuan Huy, Sam Vong\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nFormative Writing Assignment 20%\\nResearch Essay 30%\\nOnline exam 30%\\nAttendance and participation (including in-class exercises and presentations) 20%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"16:45:00","end_time":"18:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"16:45:00","end_time":"18:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 & 9"},{"title":"HIS Capstone II","id":"HIS402_Spring2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Offering Status","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002X92izQAB/his402spring2023s01","description":"This course is for the students who got Major Advisor\'s approval for the Capstone project in Year 4 at Fulbright. \\nPlease contact your Major Advisor to plan and complete your capstone.

Through texts, both fiction and non-fiction, we chart the emergence of the \u2018modern\u2019 fashion system and learn how fashion mediates our understanding of a literary text. By the 1860s, fashion had become an integral part of daily urban life, an expression of modernity itself in the words of French poet Charles Baudelaire. Why did, for instance, canonical writers like Charles Baudelaire and Colette also happen to work as fashion journalists?\\nIn what ways did the cultural mapping of fashion conducted by these writers from three distinct geographic areas diverge and converge? Why do so many modernist texts in the 20th century revolve around themes of dress? At once social, economic, political, and aesthetic in nature, fashion provides us with a unique lens through which to examine literature and culture. Key themes explored in the course include: rise of the modern city; gender and identity; class and capital; fashion and the environment. Some of the texts studied in the course include but are not limited to: \u201cSartor Resartus\u201d (Thomas Carlyle), \u201cPainter of Modern Life\u201d (Baudelaire), Ladies Paradise (Zola), Orlando (Virginia Woolf) and Banjo: A Story without a Plot (Claude McKay), among others.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After successful completion of the course, students will be able to:\\n1. Acquire an analytical and critical vocabulary in the study of literature, especially about narrative structure.\\n2. Conduct close readings of literature with an awareness of the strategic use of clothing and accessories in narratives.\\n3. Improve argumentative writing skills through weekly written assignments and papers.\\n4. Extract abstract and complex ideas from texts and discuss them in class.\\n5. Produce interdisciplinary connections by comparing historical, social, and artistic perspectives on the development of fashion across French, British, and American literary traditions.\\n6.

In an age where queerness, like the show, is as ubiquitous McDonald\u2019s corporatized branding of its various products for mass consumption, what radical politics does a category like queerness still hold, and to what extent is this reflected by global trends and the myriad of modernities? Indeed, for many activists, it might be said that RuPaul is as radical as McDonald\u2019s is gourmet. In this class, we will attempt to think through this question by analyzing a broad selection of cultural products across the globe ranging from film, music, to literature and social media that deals with queerness.

least one 200-level course in Psychology\\n---\\nCourse Description: Applied Social Psychology provides students with an understanding of how knowledge produced in the subdiscipline can be used to better understand aspects of everyday life and to address broader social problems and issues. These include intimate relationships, sexuality, leadership, work, teams, environmental problems, popular culture, body image, digital gaming, social media, addiction and the conflict between traditional values and modern lifestyles. These topics will be explored in relation to our sense of self and identity, social interactions, intergroup relationships, how people develop knowledge of the world and the situated nature of human existence. The course assumes that social psychology is more than a spectator sport by making links between theory, research and action. Guiding such work is the proposition that human beings have innate dignity and should be afforded equitable chances to flourish in life.\\n---\\nSyllabus\\nSession 01: Introduction to Applied Social Psychology\\nReadings:\\nHodgetts, D., Stolte, O., Sonn, C., Drew, N., Carr, S., & Nikora, L.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \\nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \\nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2VW_ACdTlNzySiySyfPfOrgxQztprrzGxxL_2pfo5Q/edit?usp=sharing \\nSummary \\nUnit One: Foundational Questions \u2013 This unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. The primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. Each week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d This unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \\n Unit Two: The Human Experience \u2013 This unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. Each week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis. Different iterations of the class can select form a list of topics depending upon the instructor\u2019s preference. These topics include: Food, Sex, Death, Wealth, Nations, Power, Religion, Language, Law, Morality, Race. Readings include Margaret Wilson\u2019s Indulgence, Sidney Mintz\u2019s Sweetness and Power, Renato Rosaldo\u2019s Grief and the Headhunter\u2019s Rage, Marshall Sahlins\u2019 The Original Affluent Societies, Erik Harms\u2019s The Boss, Ernest Gellner\u2019s Nationalism, Benedict Anderson\u2019s Imagined Communities, Alice Goffman\u2019s \u2018On the Run\u2019.

The course charts the evolution of ethnographic films from their initial concerns with representing the \u201cOther\u201d to their shifted attention to reflexivity and the politics of knowledge production across cultural boundaries. Throughout the course, we will be addressing various ethical, formal, and thematic concerns underlying contemporary thinking about ethnographic filmmaking. A variety of experimental ethnographic film and video makers will be introduced in weekly lectures and screenings. In the course of the semester, students will also be researching, assembling material, interviewing, and editing three short assignments and a final project that responds to the different thematical focuses. The formats utilized to produce these projects may include single-channel video, interactive video, or video installation. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nThis course aims to move beyond the fundamentals of ethnographic filmmaking toward the identification of this genre as an interdisciplinary art form, intricately intertwined with other disciplines of art and regimes of representation. As such, after successful completion of this course, students will be able to: \\n1. Comprehend foundational terminologies and techniques in ethnographic filmmaking.\\n2. Distinguish the major developments in the field of visual anthropology as related to the form of ethnographic film.\\n3. Interpret and apply social inquiries to cinematic language.\\n4.

Also, students of history of international relations, digital anthropology, and other pol sci, IR and social studies course could find this course worthwhile.\\n---\\nCourse Description: This multidisciplinary course focuses on the role of technology and innovation in the development and conduct of military conflict. Starting with a historical narrative, the course aims to highlight how and in which role technology and innovation have influenced military conflict. This section aims to highlight how military conflict, throughout the ages, has changed in its military, political and economic dimensions and the societal consequences of these. Subsequently, the course moves to the 21st century and analyses new technologies, such as drones, cyber systems, and other on-or-over-the-horizon technologies, such as AI, big data, and deep learning. Here it seeks to assess how these technologies will impact the current notion of military conflict. Finally, the course seeks to engage in theoretical discussion on the political, legal, ethical, and moral considerations of conflict in the past, present, and future.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\n1.

Why do we have sex? Moreover, how can we study sex anthropologically and ethically? Both in terms of male/female bodily sexes and in terms of sexual play and desire, sex has been a central concern to anthropologists since the very founding of the discipline in the late nineteenth century. This course analyzes the various aspects of sex from the perspective of two subfields of anthropology: sociocultural anthropology and linguistic anthropology. This includes but is not limited to: social and linguistic constructions of sex and gender; gendered violence; power and language; the regulation of sex; and the queering of sex. Course readings will draw broadly from both historical and contemporary work within sociocultural and linguistic anthropology, as well as critical works (theoretical and historical) in gender/sexuality studies.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of this course students should be able to:\\n1. Critically identify and discuss the ways in which sex (and gender) are constructed within different social contexts\\n2.

This course looks at law from an anthropological perspective, investigating: (1) what is law in different cultures? (2) to what extent is 21st century law a culture in itself? Students will be exposed to a wide range of sociolegal scholarship with a specific focus on themes of law, social regulation, politics, and bureaucracy. By the end of the class, students will conduct and share research on a legal culture of their choosing.\\n---\\nMain Topics:\\nUnit One: Law Before Law\\nThis unit looks at sociolegal theory before the emergence of anthropology. Readings from classical texts including: Plato, Tacitus, Henry Maine, Lewis Henry Morgan, Max Weber, Karl Marx.

We will investigate the central themes, theories, concepts, and questions of the contemporary study of comparative politics and explore the main theoretical, empirical, and methodological approaches to the study of Vietnamese politics. Why do nation states vary so substantially in their political freedoms and economic performances? What are similarities and differences that Vietnam bears from a comparative perspective? This course will seek to answer these big questions by developing an understanding of key concepts, theories and political system and policies of Vietnam. The course intertwines two major parts with Part I forming the foundation of the course by introducing the history, concepts, theories, and methodologies of Comparative Politics and the other exploring the actors and processes involved in the detailed case study, Vietnam. The course has a strong discussion-centered structure. Students are expected to read the assigned materials timely and thoughtfully and be ready to discuss the content in class.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Students should be able:\\nTo demonstrate a basic understanding of the relationships between individuals, actors, and processes across different political systems both historical and contemporary.\\nTo facilitate and/or cultivate a sense of critical awareness of the world beyond their own.\\nTo develop a stronger understanding of fundamental differences between different regime types, the relationship between politics and economic outcomes, the role of identity in politics.\\nTo apply the analytical and methodological tools of comparative politics to political outcomes they want to understand and explain.\\nTo use these tools to further examine the political system and policies of Vietnam. \\n---\\nCourse Readings:\\nThere is no textbook for this course.

It could as well be deeply latent inside the personal consciousness or at the hidden corner of the social collective mind. How will those quasi-transparent and subterranean features look like when they are visualized into such a grand expressive audio-visual art form as cinema? That is the first question for examination inside this course. By zooming into Vietnamese identities on contemporary Vietnamese big screen, the course is to carry out a thorough surgery on this matter of a \u201cnation in transition\u201d (William Lim, 2001) in the complex postmodern global context. This course focuses on the identity literacy for those who would like to take it seriously on Vietnam studies and particularly those who are interested in researching them through film aesthetics. First and foremost, it examines what identity is under theoretical viewpoint as well as its major attributed components as gender, race, class, and nation. In parallel, it re-examines what Vietnamese identities have been and what are the new layers of Vietnamese identities which are being reconstructed in the contemporary epoch.\\nAfter providing a brief knowledge on film aesthetics, the course will make use of those understandings to analyze and critique how contemporary Vietnamese filmmakers (of the 21st century) convey their personal as well as collective Vietnamese identities through each filmmaker\u2019s aesthetic choices. Those are not historical lessons on Vietnamese cinema since its birth but zooming into the contemporary Vietnamese film instead. More precisely, after the U.S opened the embargo with Vietnam, which opened a new chapter for the country in transition, the new epoch of Vietnamese cinema has also been opened, with a booming market and a radical of art-house and experimental genres having been emerged. For nearly thirty years, a new wave of contemporary filmmakers in Vietnam have been reinventing various aesthetic choices of the classic world cinema in order to shape a new face of Vietnamese cinema as well as Vietnamese collective identities. Hence, reading the embedded Vietnamese identities being embedded on Vietnamese big screen can\u2019t be distinguished from reading how Vietnamese cinema has been transformed aesthetically.\\nBy reading theories and defining specific cases on personal and collective identities on Vietnamese cinema inside its present socio-political context, this course aims to provide students a full and well-rounded understandings on the complex Vietnamese identities at the moment. Also, by the end of this course, students are expected to grasp a more well-rounded knowledge on cinema aesthetics and the way a film\u2019s visual and aural features are used to create essentially non-narrative dimensions of film, including the film\u2019s \u2018look\u2019.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students in this course will:\\n1. Evaluate Vietnamese identities and how contemporary Vietnamese films applying different aesthetics to convey its embedded identities.\\n2. Understand the distinctions between personal, collective and national identities and how they are conveyed as a part of film politics.\\n3. Explore Vietnamese complex socio-cultural materials for future courses of Vietnamese studies as well as film studies.\\n4. Write critiques on films in formal academic form with full understandings of film language.\\n5. Gain knowledge of the living history of contemporary Vietnamese film scene and identify conventions and elements of their aesthetics\\n6.

Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Students will be exposed to \u201cVietnamese Studies\u201d currently practiced inside and outside Vietnam to realize which approaches have been employed in this interdisciplinary field, and how the field significantly varies in different geo-political, socio-cultural environments, depending on who is doing it and in which contexts it is carried out.

Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts.\\nNowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular. Based on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Having finished this course, students will:\\n1. Have basic knowledge of Vietnamese Literary Chinese (writing, reading, grammar)\\n2. Attain a vocabulary of 800 words of Vietnamese Literary Chinese.\\n3. Gain the ability to read poems or tales in Vietnamese Literary Chinese.\\n4.

In the practical knowledge section, we will be examining the current state of film production in Vietnam (from the beginning of the 21st century until the present day) by analyzing several popular production models: state funded films, films partially subsidized and commissioned by the government, privately investments, international co-productions, foreign films shooting and hiring crews in Vietnam and independent films seeking finance from domestic and international funds. This section also provides in-depth analysis and comparison regarding different systems of public policy directed towards the cinema industry in Vietnam and other countries such as Korea, China, France and America, apparent in their regulations, development strategies and various situations of censorship. Students will be able to grasp an understanding of how a country\'s public policy impacts the development of its cinema. \\n\\nThe screenwriting exercises, which take up to 75% of the class, will guide students through the process of coming up with ideas suitable to be developed in the context of aforementioned models of production as well as their capacities. Students will be trained to present these ideas in a professional format of a comprehensive look-book that is ready to pitch to potential production companies or investors. \\n\\nDepending on their progress, students are encouraged to develop ideas that challenge the audience\'s usual watching habits, the industry\'s current ability to produce as well as stereotypes about Vietnamese films and censorship in order for them to optimize their imagination and creativity. We hope the students can start contemplating on their own path to materialize the ideas that are \'impossible\' in the current context yet possible in the near future. \\n\\nThere will be two (tentative) guest speakers, Mrs. Dinh Thi Thanh Huong, Vice President of Galaxy Media & Entertainment and Director Charlie Nguyen, who will discuss with students on related topics.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to  \\nRECOGNIZE that historical and cultural heritage, as well as regional and global contexts, are all essential to understanding Vietnam;  \\nLISTEN, SPEAK, READ, and WRITE languages essential for understanding Vietnam, including but not limited to: classical/vernacular Chinese, N\xf4m script, and French at CEFR Level A2 or equivalent; \\nPERFORM close-readings and critical interpretations of texts and other media authored by local and international scholars, writers, and cultural producers;  \\nCOMMUNICATE and COLLABORATE effectively in intercultural environments;  \\nFORMULATE and CONDUCT substantial independent research projects;  \\nAPPLY interdisciplinary skills and methods to address contemporary issues and become active citizens in Vietnamese society. \\n---\\nSyllabus\\nSECTION 1 \\nSession 1: Overview of film production in Vietnam from the beginning of 21st century to the present day (Lesson 1): The rapid change of the global film market perceived through the tendency of the audience, the way movies are produced and consumed, the dominance of major cinemas and their impacts on Vietnamese cinema \\n+ What has Vietnamese cinema done to survive in this fiercely competitive and rapidly changing landscape? \\nThe government\'s unsuccessful attempts to regain the dominance through state-funded productions: why did state-funded movies fail and why has this string of failures persisted to this day with no resolution?
