They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\\n---\\nSample Topic Schedule\\n\\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\\n1.

Photography is present in a wide range of practices from avant-garde arts to mass media, from the convention of photo identification to the techniques of surveillance, from photojournalism to selfies and Instagram. Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded. With special attention to the intersection of photography and Vietnamese history, the course will also demonstrate how constellations of power - with regards to class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economy, and geopolitics - influence the practice, dissemination, and preservation of photography in Vietnam today.\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe course is designed to encourage students to: \\nAcquire a solid foundation on key theoreticians and artists who have engaged with the medium of photography. \\nAdopt an integrated range of flexible, research-led approaches to the studies of photographic history and theories. \\nStrengthen key skills in writing, reading, and public engagement necessary for higher-level courses in the Art and Media Studies major as well as related fields.","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 (BW)"},{"title":"Introduction to Video and Film Production","id":"ARTS104_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Trinh Dinh Le Minh","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdwfQAA/arts104fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Trinh Dinh Le Minh - Email: minh.trinh@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nPre-requisite: No\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThis video and film production course will introduce students to the basic elements of recording and combining image and sound using various kinds of digital equipment. We will also explore important technical and theoretical concepts associated with the moving image, such as editing, dialectic, representation, and protest. We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage. A core component of these assessments will be presentation and engagement on critique days.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:\\n1.

What does it mean to make theater today? What can we learn from a form of performance that has continuously strived to establish itself as a form of art throughout history? This course introduces Theater as a Practice: it provides an overview of the developmental history of theater while introducing students to its experimental forms. It encourages learning by juxtaposing conventional/historical ways of making theatrical works to contemporary interdisciplinary approaches, which engage visual art, philosophy, psychology, architecture, and new media, to ultimately create new collective experiences. Students will learn the essentials of a theater work, and will be able to apply what they have learned by creating a work of their own. As a crucial component of collaborative learning, students will learn to give informed and respectful feedback to a work-in-progress, the building block of experimental theater.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After the course, students will be able to:\\nObserve, identify, and analyze the key component(s) of a theater work.\\nConduct research on theater/performance and clearly communicate their findings.\\nUnderstand and evaluate interdisciplinary approaches to theater-making.\\nStage a short performative theatrical piece.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nThe below content can be spread out between 10 and 14 weeks so that students have sufficient time for practice, critique, and production.

Instead of taking the form of a country survey, the course is thematically structured, with topics informed by artistic practices and concerns. As such, the course emphasizes close analysis of selected case studies and the works of artists who are considered among the most historically significant from the Asian region and its diasporas. This approach helps us understand contemporary art practice as intellectually conditioned, transnationally networked, and as something embedded in both local and global economic, cultural, and political developments. In addition, close examination of artworks will enable students to gain a deeper understanding of how these artists have navigated and continue to navigate the specificities of local histories, sensorial encounters with changing materials, technologies, and spaces, and the complexities of identity and belonging.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:\\nIdentify important contemporary artists in Asia and its diasporas, and situate their practices within national and transnational historical, cultural, and political contexts.\\nDemonstrate advanced skills in visual and textual literacy, demonstrable through analysis of sophisticated artworks and challenging texts in contemporary art criticism and scholarship.\\nEmploy relevant theoretical methods for interpreting contemporary artworks.\\nAcquire competency in scholarly research, effective oral presentation, and academic and curatorial writing required for continued graduate study and career pathways in industry professions.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nProvisional topics:\\n\xb7 \u201cContemporary Asian Art\u201d: Mapping the Field\\n\xb7 Video Art and Cybernetics\\n\xb7 Women Performance Artists from Japan\\n\xb7 Conceptualism in Southeast Asia: The Artist-Curator\\n\xb7 Pop and Politics in Late Socialist China\\n\xb7 Contemporary \u201cBuddhist\u201d Art?\\n\xb7 Relational Art and Social Engagement\\n\xb7 The Artist and the State in Singapore\\n\xb7 Art, Activism, and Islam in Indonesia\\n\xb7 Feminist Cyborgs / Posthuman Bodies\\n\xb7 Spectacle, Surveillance, and Art Superstars in China\\n\xb7 The Rise of \u201cContemporary Asian Art\u201d\\n\xb7 One Artist Talk\\n\xb7 One Field Trip\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading\\nWeekly Discussion Questions 10%\\nParticipation 10%\\nPresentation: Artwork Case Study 20%\\nBook Review 25% (1000-1250 words)\\nExhibition Proposal 30% (2000-2500 words)","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"12:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 2"},{"title":"Animation and Graphic Media in East Asia","id":"ARTS307_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Linda Zhang","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdwlQAA/arts307fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Dr. Linda C.

But how does animation \u201cpervade\u201d through different cultural, political, and economic contexts, even affecting expression, medium, and even technologies associated with animated forms? This course is structured by the idea of animation \u201cpervading\u201d throughout East Asia historically and also theoretically. To begin, we will start with theoretical discussions about the potential in the motion and form of animation. Simultaneously, we will discuss other forms of graphic media to question what pictures reveal about themselves, in terms of materiality, visuality, and language. During the semester, we will focus on different case studies of popular mass media and print cultures in the early 20th centuries in East Asia, such as wartime and postwar cel animation films, as well as adaptations of manga, manhua, and manhwa into print form, film, television, video games, and even fan culture. This course is also concerned with how serialization, translation, and adaptation affect the relationship between \u201coriginal\u201d and \u201ccopy.\u201d To study these questions, students will be asked to conduct a research presentation on East Asian comics and animation, write a critical review of one form of serialized animation or graphic media, and to write and design a final project exploring the theories and forms of moving-image and print culture that we have discussed during the semester.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nDemonstrate familiarity with animation directors, graphic writers and artists from China, Japan, and Korea\\nAnalyze films and literary texts, annotate with proficiency in filmic (visual, audio) and literary formal techniques; engaging with the field theorists in animation, literature, and graphic media\\nWrite, construct, and present reviews, rationales, and essays into a clear, original, and persuasive interpretive claims, in both oral and written formats\\nConduct and present interdisciplinary research across the arts, media, and literary disciplines\\nDesign graphic media and animation project synthesizing theoretical readings and case study research from the course\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1 (August 28-31) Introductions to the course \u2013 Pictures and the Animated Form\\nReadings:\\n- Eisenstein, Sergei.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future. Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After completing the course, students will be able to\\n1. Understand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\\n2. Define the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\\n3.

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives\\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\\n---\\nCourse Materials:\\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas.

Answer: They all use auctions. Auctions are pervasive in our everyday lives. An auction does not necessarily consist of raising your hand to place a bid (or clicking on a button on eBay). There are many different types of auctions: descending auctions, second price auctions, reverse auctions, simultaneous ascending auctions, combinatorial auctions are just a few examples. Each auction format is adapted to a specific situation, and understanding what the key differences between various auction formats are and under which circumstances one should use a specific auction format will be one of the main purposes of this course. The starting point will consist of a reflection on what a market is and show that the very specific details about how demand and supply \u201cmeet\u201d can have a profound impact. The first half of the course will present the main auction formats and discuss their differences. The second half will focus on market mechanisms where there is no price, such medical resident match or school assignments. In both topics, the course will alternate between theoretical analysis and real-life implementations.\\n\\n(Adapted from GU 4260: Market Design (SPRING 2019) at Columbia University - Instructor: Guillaume Haeringer)\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\n- Explain the procedures and properties of the main auction formats and discuss their differences and suitability to different situations.\\n- Explain and critique common real-life applications of the aforementioned auction formats, such as eBay, Google/Facebook ad auctions, etc.\\n- Explain the procedures and properties of the main matching mechanisms and discuss their differences and suitability to different situations.\\n- Explain and critique common real-life applications of the aforementioned matching mechanisms, such as the matching of medical residents, school assignments, etc.\\n- Apply the action formats and matching mechanisms they learn to design a solution to practical real-world problems.\\n- Collaborate and work in teams effectively.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nThe recommended textbook for this course is \u201cMarket Design: Auctions and Matching\u201d by Guillaume Haeringer (MD for short), which has been requested for the library.

For example, they are the heart of a wide range of applications, from healthcare, smart homes and cities, transportation, and manufacturing. For example, a real-time embedded system that we use daily is smartphones, which feature multiple sensors like accelerometer, proximity, gyroscope, GPS position, and fingerprint. The systems must react to events in the external, often analog, environment within a predefined time limit and subject to hardware constraints, such as memory, computational capability, and power consumption. This imposes several challenges in acquiring and processing raw data from sensors to derive meaningful information and making suitable decisions to control the environment using actuators. This course introduces students with the fundamentals of designing, implementing, and analyzing real-time digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms in embedded systems, including required theory on key DSP concepts, the hardware used to sample and process the signals, and software development environments. In the first half of the course, structured laboratory assignments familiarize students with the hardware and software. In each lab, students will implement and evaluate multiple DSP algorithms for a given application such as sampling and digital filtering. Each algorithm can achieve a certain signal quality but a certain implementation cost, e.g., run-time complexity, which measures how fast the algorithm executes or runs on the input data to produce output data. As a critical thinking exercise, students will explore design tradeoffs in signal quality vs. run-time complexity. In the second half of the course, student groups will work on extensive real-time DSP projects of their choice to develop system-level design skills in a complex, unstructured problem context. Smartphones and STM32 high-performance microcontrollers would be the target real-time embedded systems for the labs and project.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will:\\n- Acquire an appreciation of the importance of real-time DSP for a broad class of real-world engineering applications;\\n- Learn and explain key concepts, ideas, and methods in a signal processing application area;\\n- Use multiple technical information resources, including library resources such as the research literature, the World Wide Web, and consultation with experts, to independently learn about advanced topics and to overcome technical obstacles;\\n- Identify and use a modern embedded DSP hardware system and development environment to develop, debug, refine, defend, implement, and test real-time digital signal processing algorithms for practical applications;\\n- Recognize, appreciate, and evaluate the tradeoffs necessary in algorithm design for real-time DSP implementation in embedded systems;\\n- Work jointly with peers in developing, debugging, and testing code and in completing laboratory assignments and term-projects;\\n- Complete and demonstrate a successful implementation of a digital signal processing design project in an embedded system; and\\n- Document a signal processing design project, including the engineering principles, procedure, implementation, and testing;\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek\\nDates\\nLecture\\nContent outline\\nLab assignments\\n1\\nAug. 28 - Sep. 03\\n1\\n- Course introduction\\n- Ground rule co-design\\n- Hardware and software introduction\\nLab #1: Overview of hardware and software tools\\n2\\nHardware implementation of sinusoidal generation algorithms\\n2\\nSep. 04 - Sep. 10\\n3\\nLab #2: Smartphone-based data acquisition processing\\n4\\n3\\nSep. 11 - Sep. 17\\n5\\nSignals and systems review and extension\\nLab #3: Sine wave generation\\n6\\n4\\nSep. 18 - Sep. 24\\n7\\n8\\nDigital filter design and hardware implementation: Overview\\n5\\nSep. 25 - Oct. 01\\n9\\nDigital filter design and hardware implementation: Finite Impulse Response (FIR)\\nLab #4: IMU pedometer\\n10\\n6\\nOct. 02 - Oct. 08\\n11\\nLab #5: Digital filters\\n12\\nDigital filter design and hardware implementation: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)\\n7\\nOct. 09 - Oct. 15\\n13\\n14\\n8\\nOct. 16 - Oct. 22\\n15\\nSampling and aliasing review and hardware implementation\\nLab #6: Data scrambler\\n16\\n9\\nOct. 23 - Oct. 29\\n-\\nMidterm break - no lectures\\nNo lab sections\\n10\\nOct. 30 - Nov. 05\\n17\\nMid-term exam\\nTerm-project proposal development and submission\\n18\\nAmplitude quantization\\n11\\nNov. 06 - Nov. 12\\n19\\nShort-time spectral analysis\\nLab #7: Spectrogram\\n20\\nCorrelation analysis\\n12\\nNov. 13 - Nov. 19\\n21\\nAudio DSP: Overview\\nLab #8: Guitar special effects\\n22\\nAudio DSP: Pitch modification\\n13\\nNov. 20 - Nov. 26\\n23\\nAudio DSP: Acoustic localization\\n-   Lab #9: Pitch detection\\n-   Project proposed design review\\n24\\n14\\nNov. 27 - Dec. 03\\n25\\nSpecial topics: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\\nLab #10: Pitch synthesis\\n26\\n15\\nDec. 04 - Dec. 10\\n27\\nSpecial topics: Image processing\\nTerm-project development and finalization\\n28\\nSpecial topics: Video Kalman filter\\n16\\nDec. 11 - Dec. 17\\n-\\nBack-up for lecture (if needed)\\n-\\nFinal Term-project presentation\\n17\\nDec. 18 - Dec. 24\\n-\\nBack-up for lecture or presentation (if needed)\\n\\nTextbooks:\\nR.

Despite its fundamental role in world history, it has received little attention until the 19th century, when the region came under Western rule and/or influence. Southeast Asia is a vast and complex region comprised of eleven independent states: Brunei, Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. It has one of the world\'s greatest ethnic, linguistic, religious, and cultural diversity. Throughout the semester, students will explore: Indianization, Sinicization; state formation and development; trade and circulation of ideas; Islamization, and Christianization; Asian colonialisms; Western colonialism and its legacies; nation-building; decolonization and birth of Southeast Asian nations; postcolonial regimes, \u201cAsian values\u201d, and \u201cdemocracy\u201d; politicization of the religions and radicalization; minority struggles, separatism, and autonomy. Finally, to get a more nuanced approach of the events, students will have the opportunity be introduced to vernacular sources and Southeast Asian perspectives on events that affected their societies and historical developments but had also a deep impact on the formation of Southeast Asia as we know it today.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:\\nWith a foundational grounding in history and theory, students will comprehend the broader processes of empire, political communities, transnationalism, interethnic association, politicized religions and competition.\\nStudents will apply these lessons to study other contexts in Vietnam, Southeast Asia, and the world.\\nThrough readings, discussions, and debates, students will learn to critically analyze primary and secondary sources, to address fundamental questions of historical change, and develop evidence-based argumentation.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nSelected readings:\\nCase, W. 2002.

Often that history is hotly contested. This gateway course introduces students to the dynamic field of history and explores not only how we study the past, but how historical narratives are created, used, and abused in the present. Every year students will explore a special theme as way to probe the origins of the profession, develop historical literacy, and challenge their assumptions about objectivity. They will also acquire the skills necessary to read and analyze primary and secondary sources, investigate complex and often sensitive historical questions, and critically evaluate arguments about past events presented in traditional print media, online spaces, and the public. This year Exploring the Past will investigate \u201cGlobal Saigon.\u201d By examining a diverse array of topics from food and architecture to religion and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, students will study the connections the world has made to Saigon and Saigon has made to the world. In so doing, students will better understand how to analyze the often controversial historical narratives that surround colonialism, capitalism, communism, and migration, as well as how Vietnam\u2019s past gets written\u2014and by whom.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nIntroduction: What is History?\\nThe Landscape of History and Thematic Module I [Locating Global Saigon]\\nHow to Read Like a Historian, Part I: Developing Historical Literacy\\nCan History Be Objective?\\nThematic Module II [Nam Ti\u1ebfn(s): Past and Present] (Media Review Due)\\nHow to Read Like a Historian, Part II: Primary and Secondary Sources\\nThematic Module III [Relgion: Temples, Mosques, and Cathedrals] and Thinking Historically Practicum\\nThe Uses and Abuses of History, Part I\\nThematic Module IV [Food: Colonial Diets and Anxiety]\\nThe Uses and Abuses of History, Part II\\nThematic Module V [Music: Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll in Southern Vietnam] (Object Histories Due)\\nObject History Presentations and Thematic Module VI [Saigon Overseas]\\nWho Owns the Past?

From outcasts and outlaws to religious fanatics, failed revolutionaries, ethnic minorities, \u201ccollaborators,\u201d and distant subjects from the far reaches of the French empire, students will interrogate the dynamics of colonialism by studying those who both resisted and assisted imperial rule \u201cfrom below.\u201d While rooted in history, this course will draw on research and conceptual tools from adjacent fields, including anthropology, gender studies, literature, and political science to ask what\u2014and who\u2014is revealed and obscured in the archives, works of literature, and official accounts used to study colonial Indochina. By focusing on the experiences of colonization rather than the institutional histories from which many are excluded, students will hone their social history skills and better understand how the past marginalization of people who ended up \u201closing side\u201d of history continues to affect social relations in contemporary Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. At the end of the course, students will research, curate, and present a digital archive project that highlights an individual or group from the colonial period who remain overlooked in contemporary histories of the region.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will:\\nUnderstand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos during the French colonial period.\\nAcquire and apply the methodologies of social history.\\nCompare and contrast how various historical phenomenon and ideologies (e.g. nationalism, colonialism, capitalism, communism) affected different social classes in colonial-era Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and trace how the legacies of these histories affect social relations in the present.\\nCritically analyze and evaluate primary and secondary sources to locate marginalized historical actors and address fundamental questions of historical social change in French Indochina.\\nCraft evidence-based argumentation through research and written assignments aimed at both academic and public audiences.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\n1.

Developed in dialogue with the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam and active and retired Vietnamese diplomats, History of Vietnamese Diplomacy invites the students to walk in the footsteps of the lucky few who have shaped Vietnam\u2019s place in the world from 1945 to the present day, through collection and examination of rare and valuable historical documents and oral histories for classwork and independent research.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\nStudents will be introduced to research methodologies in the field of diplomatic history\\nStudents will gain knowledge in Vietnamese diplomatic history\\nStudents will be introduced to key online and off-line resources for the study of Vietnamese diplomatic history\\nStudents will independently learn to conduct literature reviews and write annotated bibliographies\\nStudents will come up with a proposal for a research project in Vietnamese diplomatic history\\nStudents will learn to peer-review each other\'s works and research collaboratively\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading\\nScaffolded assignments including: reading responses, a literature review, an annotated bibliography, a research proposal, and a short research paper.","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 7 (BW)"},{"title":"Historical Game Lab: Rivers and Exploration","id":"HIS308_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Mark Frank","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdxYQAQ/his308fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Mark Frank - E: mark.frank@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1), Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisite: One 200-level course in History or Vietnam Studies major.\\nCross-listed with Vietnam Studies (VS) major.\\n---\\nCourse Description: \\nHistorical Game Lab strengthens students\u2019 understanding of the \u201cfive Cs\u201d of the History discipline--change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency\u2014by having them design and playtest games set that embody each of these core principles. Course content focuses on the nature of modernity in the Asia Pacific region (including East, Southeast, and South Asia) from two major historical perspectives: (1) exploration and (2) river management. The semester will be split into two major units. In Unit 1, \u201cThe Age of Exploration,\u201d we will study the relationship between power and exploration along rivers and other \u201cfrontiers\u201d; by the end of this unit, students will create an interactive digital narrative that highlights connections between individual choices and broader social forces in a specific historical setting. In Unit 2, \u201cRiver Worlds,\u201d we will study patterns of human-environment relations on the Mekong, Ganges, Yellow, and other rivers and design a tabletop game that promotes understanding of those patterns. This unit will include a field trip to the Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve for first-hand experience of state-river relations. Lectures and readings will cover everything needed to design games based on historical research, including primary and secondary sources on our two major themes, the basic elements of game design, and coding with the Twine platform for interactive digital storytelling.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will: \\nExplain the emergence of modernity in Asia in relation to two major themes: exploration and river management. \\nAnalyze local case studies comparatively to highlight broad patterns in the modern history of the Asia Pacific region. \\nSynthesize a substantial collection of primary and secondary sources into a concise summary for a non-expert audience. \\nDesign interactive game experiences that communicate knowledge of broad patterns in modern history to a wider audience. \\nGuide others (including classmates) through these learning experiences by explaining the origins of the game, its historical context, and the rules of play, and collect constructive feedback in the process.\\n--- \\nTentative Syllabus\\nCourse Introduction\\nWeek 1: Overview of the region from 1800-1900; Survey of historically themed board games Reading: \u201cThe Board Games that Ask You to Reenact Colonialism\u201d \\nWeek 2: Overview of the region from 1900-present; Survey of historically themed video games Reading: \u201cThe Debate is on: Historical Accuracy and Historical Video Games\u201d \\nUnit 1: The Age of Exploration (Weeks 3-7 will pair historical content on the history of exploration in the Asia Pacific region with demonstrations of how that same content might be represented through digital game design in Twine)\\nWeek 3: Overview of the history of exploration and travel writing; Introduction to Twine Reading: Twine Harlowe User Guide \\nWeek 4: Travel writing and colonialism; Macros, variables, and conditional statements Reading: Excerpts from Qing Colonial Enterprise and \u201cThe Imperial Sublime\u201d; assorted primary sources \\nWeek 5: Exploration and empire; HTML and CSS for Twine Reading: Excerpts from Rivers of Empire and River Road to China, assorted primary sources \\nWeek 6: Photography, Cartography, and nationalism; Debugging in Twine Reading: Excerpts from Siam Mapped and Frontier Fieldwork, assorted primary sources \\nWeek 7: Group work and game workshop \\nUnit 2: River Worlds (Weeks 8-11 will pair historical content on riparian history in the Asia Pacific region with examples of how that same content might be represented through common tabletop game mechanics.)\\nWeek 8: Overview of riparian history; Introduction to \u201cEuro-style\u201d tabletop game design Reading: Excerpt from Turbulent Streams \\nWeek 9: Multispecies river communities of the Asia Pacific region; Deck-building game mechanics Viewing: \u201cIn Praise of Floods\u201d by James Scott (YouTube), assorted primary sources \\nWeek 10: Modern river regimes; Worker-placement game mechanics Reading: Excerpts from Unruly Waters, assorted primary sources \\nWeek 11: Transnational rivers and their controversies; 4x strategy game mechanics Reading: Excerpts from Last Days of the Mighty Mekong, assorted primary sources \\nWeek 12: Group work and game workshop\\n\\nWeek 13: Group presentations and playtesting: interactive digital narratives \\nWeek 14: Group presentations and playtesting: tabletop games.\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading\\nAttendance and Participation, 20%\\n2 Analytical Papers, 20%\\nDigital Game Prototype, 25%\\nTabletop Game Prototype, 25%\\nFinal presentations and playtesting exhibitions, 10%","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"16:15:00"}],"location":"Meeting room 1"},{"title":"HIS Capstone I","id":"HIS401_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Offering Status","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002dLq9JQAS/his401fall2023s01","description":"This course is for the students who got Major Advisor\'s approval for the Capstone project in Year 4 at Fulbright.\\nPlease contact your Major Advisor to plan and complete your capstone.","categories":[],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Matter","id":"IS105_Fall2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Nguyen Thi Trang","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002btdxZQAQ/is105fall2023s01","description":"Faculty: Nguyen Thi Trang - E: trang.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Sciences & Engineering (E3)\\nPre-requisite: No\\nThis course was named as \\"Matter\\" in previous terms.\\n---\\nCourse Description: \\nI recently attended a lecture by Nobel Laureate Morten Meldal where he said, \u201cChemistry is everything\u201d, and I would agree with him, at least in terms of our physical world. Everything around us, our own bodies, all the things that we interact with, are a collection of chemicals. The study of chemistry thus allows us to explore and understand the matters and processes associated with nature and human life. General Chemistry is a gateway to this fascinating physical world, it offers the fundamental understanding of structures and properties of matters, from subatomic particles to macroscopic substances. It explains the rules of chemistry and physics that govern matters\u2019 behavior and interaction. What is the universe made of? Why do nuclear reactions both demand and release so much energy? Why do certain substances melt or boil at high or low temperatures? What makes a reaction go slower or faster and why do we even care? What is pH and how can our blood maintain stable pH? These are just a few of the questions we can answer in this course.

Students will learn about the diversity and evolution of microorganisms, different kinds of communication, signaling, and interactions between microorganisms, as well as the feedback loops between microorganisms and the environments. For example: students will be able to answer the question why some microbes only exist in extreme environmental conditions, or why some microbes rely on other microbes or the host to proliferate, or whether we can use microorganisms as a forensic indicator or use microbial genetic materials as biomarkers to study environmental health. Students will explore the role of microorganisms in soil formation, water quality, food production, plant health, biogeochemical cycling as well as in human civilization, including medicine, industry, biotechnology, bioremediation, or even the exploration of the outer space. Furthermore, this course also emphasizes on a variety of hands-on traditional (i.e., culturing) and advanced laboratory techniques (i.e., molecular technique) to study microorganisms. The laboratory component of the course will also introduce students to some applications of microorganisms in daily life and in solving the world problems.

Humans have always been fascinated (and disturbed) by things at the borders of \u201cpolite\u201d society. Spooky, ominous, and dark themes have endured across time, even gaining momentum in the last ten years with television like The Haunting at Hill House, novels like Mylene Dressler\u2019s The Last to See Us, or video games like the Devil May Cry series. This course will ask: why are we so fascinated by things that are spooky or supernatural? In what way is fear or dread a meaningful literary theme? And how has the gothic genre evolved to speak to us across different times and cultures? In this class, students will learn how to analyze literature, read critically, make claims about how texts work, and identify major themes and approaches. Students will also explore how texts work differently depending on their genre and form. Finally, the course will prompt students to question how literature articulates the values of the culture that produced it and to make connections between course materials and the world that surrounds them. Texts may include short stories by Angela Carter, Boleslaw Prus, and Edgar Allen Poe, novels by Henry James or Emily Bronte, and film or television by Jordan Peele and Guillermo del Toro.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\n1. Obtain a working knowledge of terms and approaches related to gothic literature, studies of fear and horror (e.g. grotesque, uncanny, abject, monstrosity, cultural studies, etc.) and how to apply them\\n2. Find balance between identifying the way that horror or fear in specific texts works to illuminate distinct cultural values and making comparative connections between texts produced in different cultures\\n3.

Second, how do those representations differ across cultures and geographies? What does that tell us about human relationships to the world around us, as well as how heterogenous those relationships can be? This course will feature materials from what we might know today as \u201cthe global south\u201d (though not exclusively) to initiate conversations about how power, oppression, and consumption affect those earlier mentioned relationships and representations. We will not only learn to shift awareness to environmental concerns in literature but also learn theories and approaches to facilitate that shift. Broadly speaking this course introduces students to the methodology of ecocriticism, or the study of ecoliterature, but also to intersectionality, where race, class, gender, and place can affect one another and manifest in literature. Readings will include Amitov Ghosh, Jamaica Kincaid, Nguyen Ngoc Tu, Jiang Rong, and Edouard Glissant.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nObtain a working knowledge of ecocritical terms and approaches (e.g. Anthropocene, ecocentrism, biosemiotics) and their application in different geographies\\nMake connections between ecocriticism and other critical methodologies (postcolonial theory, feminist theory, racial and class lenses)\\nMake connections between literary and theoretical works and the society and world around them\\nStrengthen reading and analytical skills of various genres\\nStrengthen communication skills verbally and in writing\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nRequired texts include:\\nKincaid, Jamaica.

In addition, we will spend one-third of the semester studying the literature of the Harlem Renaissance. We will situate modern American literature within its specific socio-historical, cultural, and philosophical contexts. The selected readings focus on (1) how the Great Depression had a significant impact on American writers, (2) the problem of race in literature of the Harlem Renaissance, (3) women writers and their imaginative explorations of gender politics, (4) the gap between the hopefulness of the Reconstruction era and the traditionalism of what became known as the Southern renaissance, (5) how modern authors critique American provincial life, and (6) poetry and the search for form. Besides the selected short stories, poetry, and drama, you will read three novels: Langston Hughes\'s Not Without Laughter, Hemingway\'s The Sun Also Rises, and Edith Wharton\'s Ethan Frome.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After completing this course, students will be able to:\\nunderstand the historical, cultural, critical, and especially literary contexts of modern American literature, particularly during the interwar years 1914-1945\\nunderstand the major characteristics of American literary modernism and will be able to utilize those characteristics to analyze individual works of American literature in both literary and artistic forms.\\nengage thoughtfully and openly with a range of critical and theoretical perspectives on literary and cultural (and even controversial) issues, including the ability to state clearly the assumptions and premises of their own positions.\\nperform a literary close reading (both in class discussions, exercises, and assignments and in out-of-class writing assignments), demonstrating an ability to read and interpret literary works by thoughtfully integrating quoted passages into larger argumentative claims\\nwrite clear, grammatically correct, and rhetorically effective papers of literary analysis and interpretation (and perhaps even of critique), driven by a thesis and sustained by logic, textual and historical evidence, and a reasoned, ordered, and coherent argument.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nRequired textbooks:\\n1/ The Norton Anthology of American Literature, 1914-1945 (9th edition)\\n2/ Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises\\n3/ Langston Hughes, Not Without Laughter\\n4/ Edith Wharton, Ethan Frome\\nReading schedule:\\nWEEK 1:\\nSession 1: Syllabus & Introduction\\nSession 2: Edwin A.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language.

We are spending more time and effort in borderless cyberspace but at the same time, dealing with issues in the multicultural physical space. Technology and society co-evolve, thus making it essential to understand both in order to grasp the best opportunities and also prepare for the upcoming challenges that arise from the ever increasing integration of technologies into our societies. While a discussion takes place among experts and in academia, foremost in the domain of Science and Technology Studies (STS), on the current and future social, economic, moral, legal, and political consequences, to the broader public, including early-stage students, these technologies and their implications can often remain abstract terms. One might have heard about IT, AI, big data, the Internet of Things, deep learning, or blockchain. Buzz words that we find frequently used in the international media. This course discusses these technologies, and systemically, in various sections throughout the semester, examines the social, ethical, moral, economic, political, and legal implications these technologies have and will have on societies globally. It will address critical societal challenges such as privacy, cybersecurity, misinformation, governance and politics in the digital age, media, business stability, ethics and morals in the digital age, and new modes of the workforce, among others. We will also look at internet governance as well as privacy protection rules in a global context for better understanding of global trends in building healthy relations between technology and society. Throughout, the course aims to educate students to think critically about the approaches and possible solutions to the challenges in the physical and virtual domain. The course serves as an introduction to these technologies and a moderate foray into Science and Technology Studies\' academic discipline. It should enable students to understand better the underlying technologies and the value of Science and Technology Studies (STS) while hopefully further arising interest in these subjects and into this academic discipline \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nGiven an introduction into the field of Science and Technology Studies.\\nProvide an understanding how academic profession studies technologies and technological changes.\\nUnderstand the complex relationship between technology, sciences and society\\nAnalyze important trends about the way and nature of current and emerging technological developments, allowing to gain an understanding on how technologies could develop further.\\nUnderstand the complex relationships between technology, sciences, innovation, economic, political and social dynamics, and societies\\nUnderstand how and why technology advancements have modified the physical and virtual environment of human societies\\nEnhance students\u2019 ability to approach complex problems critically, systematically and innovatory\\nDevelop students\u2019 capacity to position themselves in the emerging civilization age \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1: Class Introduction.

Its primary objective is to familiarize students with fundamental concepts and key issues related to law, politics, and society in Vietnam following the country\'s reunification. The course begins by examining the evolving structure of law and politics in Vietnam after the Vietnam War, along with the philosophical foundations, societal conflicts and political visions of the unified country. It then delves into the significant legal and political challenges faced by Vietnam during the final years of the Cold War, as well as the groundwork laid for the Doi Moi reform era. Additionally, the course investigates how classical Marxism was adapted by Vietnamese legal and political philosophers to address global changes.\\nSubsequently, the course focuses on the legal reforms of the early 1990s, led by the Vietnam Communist Party, and the development of concepts such as socialist rule of law and socialist market economy. It explores how laws were formulated as tools of governance. The course further explores Vietnam\'s legal system in the context of the country\'s global integration campaign. Specific attention is given to key legal areas such as criminal law, labor law, civil law, economic law, digital law, human rights and constitutional law. Finally, the course examines Vietnam\'s renewed interest in establishing a socialist rule of law and considers the implications of contemporary global issues on the country.\\nThroughout the course, students will be exposed to historical and comparative methods in examining the law, politics and society of Vietnam. This will raise important questions about the potential advantages and limitations of using law as an analytical category in cross-cultural studies. The course will explore the dynamics that arise when \\"Eastern\\" and \\"Western\\" legal cultures interact with each other, especially in the context of a Party State. It will also consider the significance for Marxist theorists of engaging with Western legal concepts such as contract law, company law, capital market, and human rights. Students will investigate the relationship between law, capitalism, and socialism, as well as how law shapes global political and socio-economic relations. The course will analyze how law both produces and constrains subjects and identities\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to:\\nExplain how historical and cultural forces underlay contemporary legal discourse in Vietnam.\\nIdentity and analyze key issues facing Vietnamese law today\\nApply social and legal theory to analyze law both in Vietnam and abroad.\\nDiscuss the role of law in everyday life in contemporary Vietnam.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nRequired Text: Mark Sidel, Law and Society in Vietnam: The Transition from Socialism in Comparative Perspective (Cambridge Studies in Law and Society), Cambridge University Press (March 17, 2008)\\nChanges.

Under such circumstances it is nearly impossible to foresee further international developments without understanding how China approaches the world and what shapes its behavior. How can we make sense of how China makes its foreign policy at a time of uncertainty and transformation? What is, and should be, China\u2019s role and interest in addressing myriad complex global challenges? This course will explore the major issues in Chinese foreign policymaking with a particular focus on Vietnam and the U.S. as case studies. \\nThis course provides a comprehensive understanding of Chinese foreign policy. It will begin by examining the role of history, national identity, ideology, national interests in Chinese policymaking, and then explore the major institutions and actors in the Chinese foreign policymaking system. We will then examine in-depth Chinese policy towards Vietnam and the U.S. to see how Chinese foreign policymaking works. The course will also look at the historical context behind Chinese decision-making, present-day issues, and future challenges. \\nIn this way the students are expected to grasp certain background knowledge of Chinese history, political system and foreign policy process, as well as sufficient understanding of the key concepts and developments in international relations. They will both become familiar with Chinese foreign relations and enhance their conceptual understanding of the logics behind it.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: The students are expected to:\\nUnderstand/Recognize the domestic social, economic and political forces which shaped the current Chinese foreign policy (hereinafter CFP)\\nEnhance/Perform the students\u2019 understanding of contemporary CFP and its historical development through the study of China\u2019s relations with Vietnam, the US and regions of the world, and also the key issues in these relations.\\nCommunicate with structured knowledge of CFP and enable them to independently explain CFP decisions by presenting the key principles and factors shaping CFP.\\nFormulate and conduct analytical skills; facilitate their ability to formulate and clearly express arguments in writing and oral presentations.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1.

Drawing on theories from gender studies, feminist theories, media theories (including behavioural psychology and media), students will learn how to critically analyse and evaluate the relationship between gender and media using quantitative research approaches.\\nThe course emphasises the practical aspects of conducting quantitative research in gender and media studies. Students will be introduced to the process of formulating research questions that address gender-related issues in the media (including the positionality of Vietnamese women in traditional and broker-arranged marriages, Vietnamese brides and East Asian husbands in social and popular media, etc.), and they will learn how to select appropriate quantitative methods for data collection and analysis. They will also explore different techniques for collecting quantitative data, such as surveys, content analysis, and experiments, while considering ethical considerations in research.\\nApart from acquiring essential skills in data analysis and interpreting quantitative finding, students will also learn how to report research results effectively, both in written form and through visual representations. Throughout the course, students will engage in hands-on activities, including designing and conducting their own small-to-medium scale quantitative research project that investigates gender and media phenomena in the Vietnamese context.\\nBy the end of the course, students will possess a solid foundation in applying quantitative methods to explore gender and media issues in Vietnam. They will be well-informed about the relevant theories from media and gender studies, allowing them to critically analyse the influence of media on gender perceptions, stereotypes, and representations. Additionally, students will have practical skills in formulating research questions, selecting appropriate quantitative methods, collecting and analysing data, as well as reporting research results effectively.\\nNote: This course assumes a basic understanding of media studies and gender studies. Prior knowledge of quantitative methods is also preferred, but the course will revise some basic statistics and provide comprehensive instruction on conducting quantitative research in the context of gender and media studies.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will gain an understanding about of the intersections between gender and media in the Vietnamese context.\\nStudents will employ quantitative research methods, the course equips students with analytical skills to investigate and critically analyze gender-related issues in Vietnamese media, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of Vietnamese society and culture.\\nStudents will communicate their research to a wider audience via journaling and a written report.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1: Introduction week.\\nWeek 2: Media and Gender Studies: Some Key Texts and Debates.\\nWeek 3: Media Theories: Influences and Effects on Society.\\nWeek 4: Media Developments in Vietnam.\\nWeek 5: Feminist Theories: Understanding Gender and Power.\\nWeek 6: Gender (in)equality in Vietnam: Progresses over the Years.\\nWeek 7: Gender in Media: Men vs. Women, and Everyone in Between.\\nWeek 8: Gender Representation in Vietnamese Media: Stereotypes and Challenges.\\nWeek 9 \u2013 Mid-term Break .\\nWeek 10: Quantitative Research Methods in Gender and Media Studies\\nStudents are already encouraged to think of a topic of interest to later develop it into the final project.\\nWeek 11: Ethical Considerations in Quantitative Gender and Media Research.\\nWeek 12: Formulating Research Questions/Hypotheses in Practice\\nRevision of Key Media and Gender Theories from beginning of term;\\nLearn how to formulate RQs/hypotheses based on learned theories.\\nWeek 13: Choosing the Study Design: Content Analysis, Experiment, and Survey/Questionnaire.\\nWeek 14: Proposal and Feedback on Chosen Topic of Final Project\\nStudents present their chosen topic, brief their research design, and intended analysis in front of their peers and receive feedback from both instructor and peers;\\nFinal approval by instructor before commencing the project.\\nWeek 15: Interpreting Findings and Effective Presentation of Quantitative Results.\\nWeek 16: The Implications and Future of Media and Gender Studies in Vietnam\\n\\nKey readings:\\nScholten, P.

Students will choose a suggested topic or their own tentative Capstone topic of interest to prepare a research proposal. While students are expected to work on their proposal independently, teamwork is also possible (need to be approved case-by-case).\\nThe seminar structure will be flexible and be at the discretion of the faculty running the sessions. One example of the spring seminar structure includes 2 parts.\\nPart 1 (6 meetings): In this part, students focus on finding resources and conducting a literature review. In the first two meetings, faculty present their own experience on how to approach a research topic, where and how to find resources, how to conduct and write up a thorough literature review (given a research question/topic). In the next four meetings, students take turns to present their findings on their topics and receive feedback. The outcome of this part is a complete literature review.\\nPart 2 (6 meetings): Sample research proposals will be carefully analyzed by faculty in the first two meetings: how to pose a research question, how to write an introduction, how to choose methodology, and make plans. The next two meetings will be organized as Q&A sessions. Students take turns talking about their methodologies and receive feedback/suggestions from faculty. In the last two meetings, students present their research proposals as a practice defense.

Students will be introduced to key concepts related to migration and will be encouraged to critically engage with the difficulties and challenges faced by individuals and communities (of Vietnamese origin) during their migration processes.\\nThe course content delves into the multifaceted nature of migration from Vietnam, with a particular focus on the gendered aspect of the phenomenon. Students will explore how gender plays a pivotal role in shaping experiences, motivations, and vulnerabilities of Vietnamese migrants, including the exclusive obstacles faced by female migrants due to the local norms and traditions. By analysing case studies, empirical research, academic literature, and multimedia resources, students will gain insight into the diverse reasons that compel Vietnamese individuals and families to migrate, including economic opportunities, political factors, family reunification, and social aspirations.\\nThroughout the course, students will be encouraged to think critically and engage in discussions on the ethical, social, and economic implications of migration. They will examine the impacts of migration on both the sending and receiving societies, considering issues such as (gendered) identity, cultural integration, social inequality, and human rights. Furthermore, students will explore the interplay between migration policies, social structures, and individual agency, fostering an understanding of the constantly involving dynamics that shape migration processes. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with a comprehensive understanding of Vietnamese migration and how it transforms modern Vietnam. They will be able to identify and analyse the key push and pull factors driving migration, critically evaluate the gendered dimensions of migration, and appreciate the broader implications of migration on individuals and societies. The course will prepare students to engage with contemporary debates and challenges related to migration and develop a heightened awareness of the current issues surrounding migration, especially in Vietnam and the Southeast Asia region.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will gain an understanding about the broader Vietnamese diaspora and its interactions with the homeland.\\nStudents will collect and critically examine a variety of primary and secondary sources to undertake a guided research project into Vietnamese migration.\\nStudents will communicate their research to a wider audience via video and written formats.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1: Introduction week\\nLearn about students\u2019 expectations of the course/course instructor and vice versa;\\nOverview: migration as a global phenomenon\\nIntroduction to Vietnamese Migration: Historical Context and Common Migration Patterns.\\nWeek 2: Key Concepts and Theoretical Frameworks in Migration Studies.\\nWeek 3: Push/Pull Factors: Economic and Political Motivations for Migrants from Vietnam and Opportunities and Attractions in Receiving Societies.\\nWeek 4: Family and Kinship Networks\u2019 Influence on Migration in Vietnam\\nPossible guest lecturer/speaker: Lan Anh Hoang.\\nWeek 5: Gendered Dimensions of Vietnamese Migration: Roles, Expectations, and Challenges.\\nWeek 6: Internal Migration within Vietnam: Rural-Urban Dynamics.\\nWeek 7: International Labor Migration: Vietnamese Workers Abroad\\nPros and cons for the local community and economy\\nPossible guest lecturer/speaker: Isabelle Cheng.\\nWeek 8: Human Trafficking and Smuggling in Vietnam and the Southeast Asia Region.\\nWeek 9 \u2013 Mid-term Break.\\nWeek 10: Forced Migration and Refugee Movements from Vietnam.\\nWeek 11: Vietnamese Diaspora Communities: Identity, Transnationalism, and Cultural Preservation.\\nWeek 12: Remittances and Development: Economic Impacts of Vietnamese Migration.\\nWeek 13: Social Integration and Cultural Adaptation of Vietnamese Migrants\\nIn Southeast Asia vs. Western Countries.\\nWeek 14 \u2013 27/11-01/12: Social Exclusion, Discrimination, and the Marginalisation of (Returned) Vietnamese Migrants.\\nWeek 15 \u2013 04-08/12: Migration Policies and Governance: Implications for Vietnamese Migrants\\nEmerging Trends and Future Directions in Vietnamese Migration Studies\\nUrban to Rural trend: is it sustainable?\\nMigration TO Vietnam: what are the pull factors?\\n\\nKey readings:\\nScholten, P.

They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization.

While it is understood that more than two unexcused absences will result in a failing the course, there is no mark for attendance.\\n\\nStudio Journal 30%\\n(Two submissions, 15% each)\\nThe journal is a critical component of the artist\u2019s and designer\u2019s studio practice. It serves as a depository for ideas, a record of process and a platform for the development of observational skill. Students will be required to keep an A3 sized notebook journal for the class. The journal will also contain exercises completed in class and assigned homework. Students will be assessed on the completeness of the journal, the use of the journal in terms of student-directed learning, frequency and experimentation, and how it reflects the evolution of their ideas in relation to the final project.\\n\\nAssemblage Art 20%\\nStudents will combine two visual principles or elements (e.g. shape, line, rhythm, contrast, symmetry, pattern/repetition, weight, transparency, color, etc) to create a unique assemblage using both studio and found materials. Students will be writing an artwork statement explaining how their selected principle has been interpreted and realized in the artwork.\\n\\nFinal Project 30%\\nThe student will conceive of one final project for the semester in the media of their choice (e.g, drawing, painting, sculpture, digital art, installation, etc). The final project will have benchmarks that include sketching, a written statement, class critique and final projection and presentation. These benchmarks will be factored into the final assessment of the project.","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"16:15:00"}],"location":"Fine Art (BW)"},{"title":"Global Modern Art","id":"ARTS203_Spring2024_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Pamela Corey","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdfOiQAI/arts203spring2024s01","description":"Faculty: Pamela Corey - E: pamela.corey@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nPre-requisite: ARTS 101 Introduction to Visual Studies.\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThis course introduces students to significant artists and movements in modern art from the nineteenth century to the 1960s. A key area of investigation will be how the concepts of modernity and modernism have been expressed by artists in reaction to major technological and geopolitical developments in the twentieth century. We will situate artworks within their local contexts while remaining attentive to the transnational nature of certain movements. This postcolonial approach decenters the Eurocentric narrative of modern art and emphasizes how modernism emerged from sites of exchange and encounter between artistic communities in Asia, Europe, Africa, the United States, and Latin America. While students will gain familiarity with movements or themes such as realism, cubism, primitivism, surrealism, the Bauhaus, abstraction, and pop, a comparative approach to these practices in a global context (e.g., surrealist art in Paris and Cairo, abstraction in New York and Osaka) will help us better understand how modernism forged new directions in the nature of artistic representation, and more particularly, the artist\u2019s sense of their role in society and the larger world.\\n\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nDefine modernity and modernism in the context of art history.\\nIdentify important modern art movements and artists across a global comparative context.\\nDemonstrate competency in visual analysis, textual interpretation, and the use of art historical terminology.\\nAnalyze the connections between the formal attributes of artworks and their relevant historical, political, and cultural contexts.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nNot including days for revision/exams\\n1.

It aims to deepen students\u2019 understanding of photography\u2014its historical development, aesthetic considerations, and pictorial strategies\u2014through hands-on engagement with styles and concepts. The course provides an opportunity for students to expand their technical and creative range through weekly assignments and critique sessions. Students will learn the basics of digital cameras, image-editing software, and key photographic techniques. Students will examine photographic works from internationally celebrated photographers to arrive at their own understanding of how photographic images are created, reproduced, and valued within both fine art photography and photography-as-art traditions. As such, they will learn to develop conceptual ideas, offer constructive critique to their peers, and locate their work in the broader context of contemporary photographic practice. Topics for discussion include visual ambiguity, objectivity, staging, authenticity, the digital and the analogue, and AI influence on photography, among others.\\nStudents are strongly encouraged to use their own DSLR cameras.\\n\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nAfter this course, students should be able to\\n1. Cultivate an enhanced appreciation of photography as an artistic practice, to be considered across different cultural and social contexts.\\n2. Adopt a critical, research-led approach to image-making in the photographic tradition.\\n3. Strengthen key skills and techniques of photographic image-making necessary for higher level practicum-based courses in the Art and Media Studies major and other related disciplines.\\n4.

We are living in a time after the pandemic where movie theater seems to be becoming obsolete, especially due to shifts in viewing and industry practices towards streaming distribution. In turn, we should question how shifts in viewing and screening practices change how we define the cinematic experience. The course offers a new way to think about the changing spectatorship practices while also introducing Chinese-language cinema from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong since the late 1980s. Through research and writing assignments, we will focus on questions of not only where these films were produced and directed, but also how and where they were screened around the world. We will investigate past, current, and evolving viewing practices, not just in terms of circulation and screening, but also in terms of how the movie theater and theater-going are represented and commemorated within these films. Introducing major theoretical and historical scholarship on contemporary Chinese language cinema, we will consider how memories, screens, and theaters concretize the pleasure of viewing and imagining through film and media.\\n\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nCLO1.

Introduction to glazing, the addition of color using semi-transparent oil paints. *Note that direct painting requires a layer to be completely dry before painting upon. A week will be necessary for thinner layers to be ready for new layers of paint. Oil drying mediums may be used (such as Liquitex) to quicken drying times.\\n\\nSection 10: Successive Applications of Paint\\nStudents will continue toward the completion of their paintings adding new layers of color upon the dried underlayer.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future. Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nAfter completing the course, students will be able to\\n1.

By definition, a signal is any observable change in quantity over space or time. It could help observers to obtain information about a phenomenon. In nature, signals can be actions done by organisms to alert other organisms or sounds or motions by animals to alert other animals of danger or food. Advances in technology have improved the capabilities of human beings to identify, analyze and even synthesize diverse information sources such as audio (speech, acoustics, music), image (photos, videos, multimedia, medical scans), medical signals (heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity) and remote sensing data (geophysical, sensing, radar). In principle, signals could be represented as data values or abstractly as mathematical expressions. A system converts or manipulate an input signal into an output signal. Examples of systems are face recognition, video streaming, cellular phones, and smart homes. In this course, students will learn to use mathematical theory and computer simulation to develop models, to analyze and to manipulate signals and systems that vary in continuous-time and discrete time. Specifically, the course covers representation of signals and systems, systems properties, conversion between continuous-time and discrete-time, Laplace, Fourier and z-transforms, transfer functions, frequency responses, convolution, stability, feedback and control systems. Students will gain hands-on experience on how to process various types of signals and to analyze and design systems by computer simulation using MATLAB or a similar software package.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes: \\nAfter the course, students will be able to\\nDemonstrate understanding of the key concepts and mathematical representation models of signals and systems.\\nStrengthen their engineering skills involved in the design, analyze and simulation of systems process input signals in order to produce the desired outputs or to control the systems\u2019 behaviors.\\nDeepen their grasp of programming concepts and their programming skills.\\nWork effectively as a team to complete group assignments on practical signal processing applications.\\nCommunicate clearly their results via professional report writing and presentation.\\n---\\nTextbook: James McClellan, Ronald Schaffer, and Mark Yoder, \u201cDSP First\u201d, 2nd Edition, Pearson, 2017 (Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/DSP-First-2nd-James-McClellan/dp/0136019250).\\nThis textbook has a companion website for additional resources: https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/.\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\nAttendance and Quizzes: 15%\\nHomework sets: 20%\\nMidterm Exam: 15%\\nMini-projects: 20%\\nFinal Exam: 30%","categories":["E3"],"schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"}],"location":"Classroom 5"},{"title":"Computer Vision","id":"ENG301_Spring2024_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Phung Manh Duong","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdfU2QAI/eng301spring2024s01","description":"Faculty: Phung Manh Duong - E: duong.phung@fulbright.edu.vn\\nPre-requisites: Complete one of the following courses:\\nENG202 Intelligent Robot Studio: From Theory to Practice;\\nENG206 Computer modeling and simulation;\\nCS101 Computer Science 1;\\nCS102 Algorithm;\\nCS203 Computer Organization;\\nCS208 Data Science;\\nCS307 Introduction to Machine Learning;\\nCS309 Advanced Programming Techniques.\\n* Cross-listed with Computer Science (CS)\\n---\\nCourse Description: \\nComputer vision is gaining its applications from facial recognition, human pose tracking, and interactive entertainment to medical imaging and autonomous vehicles.

Technological progress in Internet-of-Things and the like allow low-cost development of sensor nodes for real time analytics, which could contribute to better business intelligence. The construction industry will become a major part of the digital transformation with the development of smart structures and cities. Furthermore, the existing infrastructure will need to be fitted with the new technologies to make them more adaptive to the new social activities and requirements. This is particularly important as the built environment usually has long life cycle and cost significantly to maintain. Performance of the built environment is shaped by multiple perspectives, which should be understood, theorized, modelled, and validated with actual measurement. Students will explore the multidisciplinary study of performance evaluation with its implication on different technological, methodological, and social aspects. Performance in the built environment will be defined with its indicator, which can be measured using sensory techniques as well as investigated through social survey. The collected data of which will be analyzed and compared against design specifications, standards, and user satisfaction to provide direction for improvement.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nTo identify performance indicators of built structures in relation to industrial standards.\\nTo examine built structures as physical and technical systems as well as service platforms.\\nTo evaluate performance of selected built structure using technical and social approaches to cover multiple perspectives of different stakeholders.\\n ----\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nTextbooks:\\nAnderson J.

Since then, it has become the leading global power, whose foreign policy not only disproportionately impacts other nations, but shapes the very structure of the international system. A grasp of American diplomatic history has become indispensable to anyone wishing to understand international politics from the beginning of the 20th century onwards.\\nThis course examines the evolution of American foreign policy through the 20th century, covering all the major events and debates of that time period, including the American decision to intervene in World War I and its consequences; the impact of America\u2019s isolationist foreign policy during the interwar years; the causes and consequences of World War II; the origins of the Cold War and American strategy; the creation and collapse of the American-led postwar economic system; American relations with allies and enemies in the Third World; and the United States in the post-Cold War World. We will also explore a range of macro-themes, including the role of ideology, race, religion, domestic politics, the institutional environment, and individual leaders in the making of American foreign policy.\\nThe goal of the course is to introduce students to the study of American foreign policy after 1898. Students will become familiar with important events, personalities, and theoretical perspectives. Students will be introduced to a range of opinions through secondary sources and trained to properly evaluate and use primary sources. Students will be expected to integrate these sources to produce two medium-length essays of five double-spaced pages each, with clear structures, coherent arguments supported by evidence where appropriate, and correct citation. Students will come away from the course with improved critical reading and argumentative writing skills, which are highly valued in most careers in an information economy.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nIdentify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\\nExplain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\\nExplain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\\nExplain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\\nPropose solutions to current challenges in dealing with the US in the world\\nCritically analyze and interpret primary sources\\nClearly articulate their ideas in written and verbal form\\n---\\nTentative Class Schedule\\nWeek 1:\\nStart Unit 1: The Cold War \\nDiscuss Rubric and Assignment Guide for Assignment 1 \\nKnow-What-Learn (KWL) to assess your knowledge of the Cold War and identify learning goals for this unit. \\nYou will individually fill out the first two columns of a KWL chart\u2014what do you know about the Cold War?

The wars in Vietnam evolved from an anti-colonial struggle into a superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As conflict in Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states and non-state actors.\\nThis course will examine critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers become so deeply involved in Vietnamese affairs? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? And what are the global legacies of the war?\\nIn addition to examining its origins and evolution, the course will use the conflict to explore broader international events and trends, including empire and decolonization, the Chinese Civil War, the Sino-Soviet Split, D\xe9tente, and the Cambodian Genocide.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nIdentify and contextualize the main events and key figures in the history of the Vietnam conflict\\nExplain the origins, evolution, and consequences of the Vietnam conflict\\nAssess the scholarship on the conflict and demonstrate an understanding of the historical debates about its causes and effects\\nDemonstrate the ability to articulate complex ideas and interpretations verbally and in writing\\nCritically analyze a range of primary and secondary sources\\nEvaluate the interplay between domestic politics and foreign affairs in a wide range of global contexts\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1:\\nCourse Introduction\\nThe Origins and Character of France\u2019s Indochina Empire\\nReading: Aviel Roshwald, \u201cColonial Dreams of the French Right Wing, 1881-1914,\u201d The Historian (1994); plus some primary sources. \\n\\nWeek 2:\\nVietnamese Anti-colonialism\\nReading: Christopher E.

Students will be expected to have a general knowledge of modern European history.\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n---\\nCourse Description: \\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, European civilization lay in ruins. Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at \u201ctrials\u201d real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and \u201cshow\u201d trials, trials of terrorists and \u201ccounter-terrorists,\u201d as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe\u2019s changing political landscape.\\n\u201cEurope on Trial\u201d is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans\u2014the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma. Students taking this course will witness how and why Europeans have constantly reexamined their past. In so doing, they will better understand Europe\u2019s present and gain a framework for analyzing more universal questions of balancing order with civil liberties, justice, and power beyond the European continent. \\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nUnderstand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Europe since 1945.\\nCompare and contrast how various postwar European political and legal systems deployed the law to address issues of justice, security, democracy, religion, and historical memory.\\nAnalyze critically visual, textual, literary, legal, and archival documentation.\\nEvaluate primary and secondary sources to address fundamental questions of historical change in Europe since 1945.\\nCraft evidence-based argumentation through written assignments that address the historical role of political systems on law and law on political systems in Europe since the end of the Second World War.\\n---\\nSample Reading List\\nMain readings for the class will include excerpts from the following texts:\\nWilliam Hitchcock, The Struggle for Europe: The Turbulent History of a Divided Continent, 1945 to the Present (New York: Anchor Books, 2004)\\nAlice Kaplan, The Collaborator: The Trial and Execution of Robert Brasillach (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001)\\nMichael R.

Topics covered include Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry (and anti-Masonic conspiracy theories), Sebastianism, the mass hysteria at Loudun, Protestant and Catholic witchcraft panic, Waldensianism, early modern appropriations of Joachim of Fiore (including by Christopher Columbus), Catholic and Protestant conspiracy theories about the other, anti-Jesuit sentiment, the Man in the Iron Mask, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (an antisemitic modification of earlier conspiracies unrelated to Judaism), the Orange Order, the KKK, and finally anti-Masonic and anti-Jesuit conspiracism in the Spanish Civil War and the Violencia in Colombia. Student research can cover any cult, occult organization or conspiratorial belief since 1450. With any luck we will also touch on a few Asian appropriations of the European occult and conspiracy beliefs touched on earlier, such as the Taiping Rebellion and the Cao Dai religion.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nStudents will explore scholarly definitions of \u201ccults\u201d (vs religions) and \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d (vs documented closed-door agendas, for example the Wannsee conference) and arrive at a working definition of each which assists them in understanding remaining course readings and provides the intellectual and methodological infrastructure for their own research.\\nStudents will explore and adopt oral history methods in order to compare the internal understanding of members of nonmainstream religious groups about their organization\u2019s history versus external, scholarly, academic, journalistic and mainstream understandings of the same history.\\nStudents will learn to analyze, verbally and in writing, ambiguously fringe, abusive, seditious or otherwise unstable groups with nuance, intellectual rigor and a certain amount of sympathy for members\u2019 self-understanding, including for groups which no longer exist but were important historically. \\nStudents will explore the contentious historiography around many important nonstandard or new religious/occult/esoteric groups and their contribution to (or lack thereof) major historical events. They will come to understand how conspiracy theories around such groups often have more explanatory power than the groups themselves. \\nStudents will learn about historical conspiracy theories around unequivocally noncult religious groups (e.g. Protestants, Muslims, Catholics/Jesuits, Jews) and/or ethnic minorities, the accompanying racialization and pathologization of practitioners/members, and associated violence. They will identify patterns of escalation and deescalation and explore questions of demarcation between religious groups and the racialization of religion beginning in the early modern era. \\nStudents will think critically about which historical assumptions by conspiracists, cult members, witchfinders, and genuine conspirators continue to manifest themselves in the present day, as well as instances of successful \u201cdeprogramming\u201d or deescalation of violence in the context of their applicability to the present.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1: Renaissance occultism, astrology, Hermeticism, Giordano Bruno, The \u201cCheese and the Worms\u201d\\nExcerpts: Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition by Frances Yates\\nExcerpts: The Cheese and the Worms by Carlo Ginzburg\\nMaurizio Campanelli, \u201cMarsilio Ficino\'s portrait of Hermes Trismegistus and its afterlife\u201d\\n\\nWeek 2: The panic at Loudun, witchcraft panic in the Protestant and Catholic world, real Renaissance serial killers\\nWilliam Smith, \u201cFriedrich F\xf6rner, the Catholic Reformation, and Witch-Hunting in Bamberg\u201d\\nIldiko Kristov, \u201c\u201cCharming Sorcerers\u201d or \u201cSoldiers of Satan\u201d?

The title of this course asks: what does it mean to be human? We will expand on that question by also asking: have technological advancements changed the definition of humanity? In what ways does the definition of humanity dependent upon other social factors such as gender, race, dis/ability, class, and nationality? And, how has literature been used as a technology for determining humanity? Through a discussion-based classroom, we will approach these questions by reading and comparing texts from multiple different literary genres, including fiction, poetry, nonfiction, and film. In this course, we will also learn to appreciate the aesthetic and functional quality of texts, focusing on style, intertextuality, and critical value. We will also explore different ways of approaching texts depending on their genre and form, and practice important skills such as close reading, developing arguments, and expressing ideas clearly orally and in writing. Finally, the course will also prompt students to question the value of literature in contemporary society, and how to make connections beyond the material with the world around them. \\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nDeveloping an argument and organized structure in a written essay\\nMaking appropriate use of primary and secondary sources as supporting evidence for claims in an essay\\nUtilizing preparatory writing strategies such as drafting, revising, and peer review to conceptualize ideas\\nIdentifying and analyzing the literary qualities of at least two forms or genres\\nConnecting the material beyond the text to other disciplines and contexts\\nObtain a working knowledge of the connection between literature/writing/language and technology, especially in regards to how literature has historically been used as a technology for determining humanity alongside other vectors of power such as gender, race, dis/ability, class, etc.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nThis course would be divided thematically into three units.

This course will examine the ways that major movements in literary criticism have responded to such questions. We will explore formalist as well as cultural and political approaches to literature, will practice different ways of reading and interpreting texts, and will investigate the broader social and intellectual implications of methods of literary analysis. We will pay special attention to modes of criticism drawing on structuralism and post-structuralism, feminist theory, queer theory, new historicism, and Marxist, psychoanalytic, and postcolonial critique.

We will ask: what is epic literature? How do texts construct literary heroes, and why are they important? What role do national heroes and epic figures play in our perception of our own culture, our community, and the outside world? Over the course of the semester, we will discover how foundational texts of epic literature from the often-misunderstood Middle Ages and early modern era ultimately underpin modern epic fantasies like Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, or Avatar. Topics may include the power of myth, epic propaganda, the warrior hero, the monstrous other, visions of masculinity throughout time, and the role of women in the hero\u2019s journey. Moreover, this class will look at medieval and early modern epics from a wide variety of cultures, both Western and non-Western, in order to challenge the idea of the universal hero; instead, we will examine how heroic and epic narratives were deeply intertwined with the values and beliefs of the cultures that produced them.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to\\nStrengthen reading and analytical skills\\nObtain a working knowledge of the epic tradition and compare Western conventions of epic with the epic in other venues (the Middle East, the Far East, etc.)\\nUnderstand how literary conventions build over time and deepen our understanding of influence (both horizontal and vertical\u2014intercultural and temporal)\\nMake connections between literary works and the society or time period that produced them\\nStrengthen argumentative ability, both orally and in writing\\nExpand their understanding of a major literary time period (the medieval) and familiarize themselves with some of its major canonical works\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nReading schedule\\nUnit 1: Foundations of Epic Literature\\nWeek 1: Course introduction\\nDay 1: Course introduction, classroom contract activity, syllabus review\\nDay 2: \u201cThe Hero Monomyth\u201d (Campbell) & Lord Raglan\u2019s characteristics\\nWeek 2: Establishing the genre of epic literature\\nDay 1: Epic of Gilgamesh I (Babylonian)\\nDay 2: Epic of Gilgamesh II (Babylonian)\\nWeek 3: Establishing the genre of epic literature\\n- Day 1: The Odyssey (excerpts: his pride, Cyclops, Calypso, and Circe episodes) (Greek)\\n- Day 2: The Odyssey (excerpts: Scylla and Charybdis, Penelope, and Odysseus\u2019 return) (Greek)\\n\\nUnit 2: The national medieval epic (8th-12th centuries)\\nWeek 4: Anglo-Saxon England \\nDay 1: History Day: Anglo-Saxon culture (5-10th c.) \\nDay 2: Anglo-Saxon culture: \u201cThe Battle of Maldon\u201d & \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d (Old English)\\nWeek 5: Anglo-Saxon England  \\nDay 1: Beowulf I (Grendel episode) (Old English)\\nDay 2: Beowulf II (Grendel\u2019s mother episode) (Old English)\\nWeek 6: Anglo-Saxon England/Transition week\\nDay 1: Beowulf III (Dragon episode) (Old English) \\nDay 2: History and material culture day: The medieval Persian Empire \\nPaper 1 due @ the end of this week\\nWeek 7: Persian national epic\\nDay 1: Shahnameh I (Birth and exile of Zal) (Persian)\\nDay 2: Shahnameh II (Return of Zal and Rudaba episode) (Persian)\\nWeek 8: Persian national epic\\nDay 1: Shahnameh III (Birth of Rostam and his exploits) (Persian)\\nDay 2: Shahnameh IV (Rostam and Shaghad\u2019s betrayal) (Persian)\\nWeek 9: Midterm break\\nWeek 10: Al-Andalusia and medieval Spain (the age of chivalry)\\nDay 1: History day\u2014 the Chivalric Era (12-15th c.) and the Reconquista\\nDay 2: The Poem of the Cid, Cantar I (Spanish)\\nWeek 11: Al-Andalusia and medieval Spain (the age of chivalry)\\nDay 1: The Poem of the Cid, Cantar II (Spanish)\\nDay 2: The Poem of the Cid, Cantar III (Spanish)\\nPaper 2 due @ the end of this week\\nWeek 12: Medieval France\\nDay 1: Chanson de Roland I (French)\\nDay 2: Chanson de Roland II (French)\\nUnit 3: Early modern iterations \u2013 the epic in a changing world (1605-1820)\\nWeek 13: Mock epic and the changing world\\nDay 1: Don Quixote I (chapters 1-7) (Spanish)\\nDay 2: Don Quixote II (chapters 8-15) (Spanish)\\nWeek 14: Early modern Vietnam\\nDay 1: The Tale of Kieu I (Vietnamese)\\nDay 2: The Tale of Kieu II (Vietnamese)\\nWeek 15: Course wrap-up\\nDay 1: Modern epics (by student selection) \\nDay 2: Modern epics (by student selection)\\nFinal project due by the end of this week\\n ---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\n20% Participation & Attendance\\n14% Reading quizzes (7 x 2% each)\\n20% Paper 1 (Close analysis/change over text paper)\\n20% Paper 2 (Historical Context/Values paper)\\n26% Final Wiki Project (6% proposal, 20% final)","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Music/Dance Room (BW)"},{"title":"Contemporary Poetry","id":"LIT312_Spring2024_S01","credits":null,"instructor":"Jasmine An","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdizYQAQ/lit312spring2024s01","description":"Faculty: Jasmine An - E: jasmine.an@fulbright.edu.vn\\nPre-requisite: Completion of all CORE AND either LIT 1XX (LIT 101, LIT 102, LIT 104) or LIT 103/LIT 201 Critical Methods in Literary Studies\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nPoetry is one of the oldest literary art forms and at first glance also one of the most inaccessible. Yet, in the contemporary moment, people across the world are increasingly (re)turning to poetry as mode of grappling with the inconceivable contradictions of modern life: pandemics, authoritarian regimes, climate change, births and deaths, quotidian celebrations, stubborn joy. \u201cI don\u2019t think poems will save us\u2014us, as in, this country, this world,\u201d writes Marlin M. Jenkins, \u201cBut poems continue to save me.\u201d \\nWhat, then, does a poem do? This course introduces students to contemporary poetry by exploring the multifaceted answers to this guiding question. Rather than attempting a comprehensive survey, we will focus our reading to trace poetic actions or what specific poems \u201cdo.\u201d In addition to poems, we will also read a selection of prose essays written by poets about poetry. Through our reading, we will situate each poem and its poetic action within the broader sociopolitical and historical context in which it was written. We will also learn to identify and analyze key poetic elements such as form, sound, lyricism, and movement. Readings will mainly consist of poets writing in English post-1975 such as Victoria Chang, Mai Der Vang, Claudia Rankine, Warsan Shire, Philip Metres, and others.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to\\nIdentify and analyze key poetic elements such as form, sound, and lyricism.\\nObtain a working knowledge of key genre differences between poetry and other literary forms (and also important overlaps).\\nMake connections between diverse poetic elements and the sociopolitical context of the poem\u2019s creation.\\nImprove their reading and analytical skills for diverse forms of poetry.\\nImprove their written and oral communication skills.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nRequired Texts:\\nMany of the primary texts for this class will be sourced from the contemporary archives of online literary journals.

These include intimate relationships, sexuality, leadership, work, teams, environmental problems, popular culture, body image, digital gaming, social media, addiction and the conflict between traditional values and modern lifestyles. These topics will be explored in relation to our sense of self and identity, social interactions, intergroup relationships, how people develop knowledge of the world and the situated nature of human existence. The course assumes that social psychology is more than a spectator sport by making links between theory, research and action. Guiding such work is the proposition that human beings have innate dignity and should be afforded equitable chances to flourish in life.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nSession 01: Introduction to Applied Social Psychology\\nReadings:\\nHodgetts, D., Stolte, O., Sonn, C., Drew, N., Carr, S., & Nikora, L.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language.

Case studies are among the essential, oldest, and fundamental research methodologies within the spectrum of qualitative research methods in social sciences. In the disciplines of political science, international relations, gender studies, communication, and media studies, among others, case studies are essential methodological tools for conducting research. As Baxter and Jack (2008) note, \u201cQualitative case study are a valuable method for [\u2026] research to develop theory, evaluate programs, and develop interventions\u201d (Baxter & Jack, 2008, p.544). Case studies allow researchers and students to understand complex to generate theories, test theories, and explore new research directions, illustrating their importance as qualitative research methods (Bhattacherje, 2008). \\nThis course will introduce students to the methodology of case study research and what a case study is. Throughout the course, students will learn about the theoretical framework of case studies, their structure, their importance, and the type of case studies in existence and widely used in social sciences. Furthermore, it discusses and highlights the (ongoing) debate in social sciences on case studies. Subsequently, students will learn how to develop their own case study research design and execute their case study research. \\nThe sum of this allows students to gain: An in-depth understanding of the importance and utility of case studies as essential research methods in social sciences, as well introduce them to developing research designs, with a particular focus on case study research design and finally gain experience in conducting case study research.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nCLO1: Students will learn about qualitative research methods \u2013 in particular case study research.\\nCLO2: Students will understand the importance of case study research, as a research method, and for social sciences.\\nCLO3: Students will learn how to conduct case study research methods (and apply these to the social sciences).\\nCLO4: Students gain practical experience conducting case study research\\nCLO5: Students gain practical experience in conducting research as a team.\\nCLO6: Develop the ability to evaluate and critique existing case study studies and identify strengths and weaknesses.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nBlock 1 Theoretical Foundations\\nWeek 1 Intro\\nWeek 2 Social Science Research and qualitative research methods.\\nWeek 3 What is the case study research?\\nWeek 4 Case study research in social sciences.\\nWeek 5 Case study research.

Start your own case study research. \\nWeek 13 Peer assessment.\\nWeek 14 End of the term recap. \\n--- \\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\nBlock 1 Assessment. Discuss a well or poorly conducted case study (20%). For the first assessment of the course, students are expected to write a 500-word essay focusing on a chosen case study. In this assignment, they will summarize the case study, explain why they chose it, and argue why it was a well-conducted or poorly conducted case study. \\nMidterm assessment: Design your case study research design (30%). The midterm aims to have students apply the theoretical foundations they learned and subsequently develop their own case study research design. This assessment will be conducted in groups of 4 to 6 students. The assessment length would be around 2000 words per group submission.\\nFinal term assessment: Execute your case study research (40%). For the final term assignment, students will conduct their case study research, again in a group of 4 to 6 students. Ideally, this is based on their midterm research design, but they can propose an entirely new project if desired. This assessment aims to have students learn how to conduct their own case study research. Students will use the final block \u201cpractice\u201d to execute their research design. In-class hours will be used to discuss research designs and execution, guide students, and for peer assessment. The expected length of their case study is about 3000 words per group submission. \\nAttendance (10%). Students are expected to participate in all classes, with a maximum of 3 classes absent. Furthermore, in class discussion is expected.

And why should we care about it? Simply defined, ethics can be understood as a system of moral principles. As stated by Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics, \u201cWe are not concerned to know what goodness is but how to become good [people]\u2026, since otherwise our inquiry would be useless.\u201d This course introduces students to key texts and concepts in the study of ethics and moral philosophy. Students will connect theoretical approaches to the study of morality to one another, and to their own lives.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\n1. Demonstrate critical reading and thinking about dense philosophical texts through oral and written articulation of different philosophical ideas\\n2. Demonstrate familiarity with classic texts and arguments related to ethics and moral philosophy through discussion and short- and long-form writing\\n3. Demonstrate familiarity with the broader intellectual history and context of ethical and moral reasoning through discussion and short- and long-form writing\\n4. Connect classical philosophical theories to contemporary local and global contexts through discussion and short- and long-form writing.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule:\\nPart One - Classical Approaches: Epistemology We begin our class with an examination of philosophy in general.\\nWe ask ourselves - what is philosophy for?

We juxtapose the thoughts of two highly influential philosophers who lived around the same time in very different places, Aristotle and Confucius.\\nWeek Three - Happiness and Virtue\\nWeek Four - Friendship and Love\\nWeek Five - Confucian Virtue Ethics\\nWeek Six - Virtuous Junzi - Confucius and Aristotle in Vietnam\\n\\nPart Three - Nature and Culture - Social Contract and Natural Law Theory\\nIn this section, we will discuss the significance of such concepts as \u201cnatural law\u201d, \u201crights\u201d, \u201clegitimacy\u201d, and \u201cliberty\u201d in the formulation of moral philosophy from the enlightenment onwards. After introducing the concept of natural law developed by Aquinas to reconcile contradictions between christian and aristotelian moral worldviews, we look at how the idea of \u201cnature\u201d has shaped philosophical thinking from Hobbes onwards.\\nWeek Seven - Natural Law, Laws of Nature\\nWeek Eight - Social Contract\\n\\nPart Four: Consequentialism and Deontology\\nWeek Nine - Eleven\\n\\nPart Five: The Problem of Evil\\nWeek Twelve - Fifteen\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\nParticipation: 20%\\nWritten Reflection: 60%\\nFinal exam: 20%","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 4"},{"title":"Disability and Culture","id":"SOCI218_Spring2024_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Liz Miles","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdjKcQAI/soci218spring2024s01","description":"Faculty: Dr. Elizabeth (Liz) Miles - E: elizabeth.miles@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisite: SOCI 102 Social Inquiry and the Social Studies.\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course is an interdisciplinary study of social understandings of disability, particularly its relationship to categories of sex/sexuality, gender, and identity. Using examples drawn from various points in history, various countries around the world, and various disability categories (psychiatric/psychosocial, intellectual, physical, etc.), students read a variety of texts, including ethnographies, autobiographies, and case studies, in order to understand the variety of the disability experience. This class draws from critical disability studies, feminist, and queer theory. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of this course students should be able to:\\nExplain the difference between the medical model and social model of disability and how these two models work in practice\\nDiscuss the social, legal, and personal effects of each model on how different cultures (including the U.S.) treat persons with disabilities\\nIdentify and explicate key themes in the study of disability from a socio-cultural perspective\\nCritically discuss bioethical debates around disability\\nIdentify and discuss how disability is experienced differently from an intersectional (class, race, gender, sex, ethnicity, nationality) viewpoint\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nWeek 1.0 Introduction to the Course; Smashing Stereotypes; Disability Theory\\nAdichie, Chimamanda Ngozi. 2009. \u201cThe Danger of a Single Story\u201d TED Talk. https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story\\nHand out syllabus\\nCourse requirements and expectations\\nQ&A\\nHayes, Michael T. and Rhonda S.

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Language is not just about communication, words such as \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  \\nLanguage is intimately tied to experience \u2013 the way we talk about an event has a bearing on how we understand that event \u2013 were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d, or an insult? As much as language is something that humans produce, language is also part of what makes us human.  \\nThis course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in the study of language, beginning with philosophical questions on the origins of human language, the creation of linguistics as a distinct field of research, and the terms by which scholars have considered the relationships between language and culture.  Core concepts include linguistic relativity, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life.

The SRV Constitution\u2019s goal of building \u201ca progressive culture deeply imbued with national identity\u201d has guided Vietnamese policy since 1992 and figures into national strategies for sustainable development for the coming decades. Similar challenges have faced many countries around the world as they undergo rapid industrialization and post-industrialization. Responding to those challenges, an array of international treaties has been developed to support national efforts and international cooperation.\\nThis 300-level course provides an overview of the development and evolution of concepts of \u201ccultural heritage\u201d over the past century and around the world, examines the existing international legal framework, and analyzes Vietnamese responses (legal and regulatory as well as practical). The course approaches heritage from the perspectives of anthropology and critical heritage studies, combining intensive analyses of heritage policy with case studies of how such policies are applied on the ground. Special attention will be given to examining recent controversies in Vietnam over different aspects of cultural heritage. The focus will be on built cultural heritage (monuments and relics) and intangible cultural heritage.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nCLO1: Situate Vietnam\u2019s approach to cultural heritage within global trends and frameworks, highlighting the Vietnamization of those international concepts and approaches\\nCLO2: Develop critical reading skills as applied to international treaties, Vietnamese domestic laws, and Vietnamese implementing regulations, emphasizing responsibilities of citizens and the state\\nCLO3: Research and analyze current cases and controversies in Vietnam\u2019s application of international heritage treaties and domestic heritage laws, highlighting critical contributions of leading Vietnamese scholars\\nCLO4: Understand how issues of heritage and identity pose fundamental challenges to Vietnamese citizens, especially young ones, as they seek to ensure a sustainable future\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nTemporary link for readings and documents: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gLaO1gAtdRtlW4Kh90BNbe9Gyv11MnOY?usp=sharing [asterisks indicate works available both in English and in Vietnamese]\\n\\nWeek one: introduction and objectives of the course\\nIntroduction of professor and students; review of syllabus and course requirements\\nGleason, Philip. 1983.

Its impact, both positive and negative, has economic, ethical, political, and sociological consequences and alters every aspect of our society. This impact process has been, however one in which accountability has been difficult. Such brings up the question: Can we control technological development? Should we even? If so, by what means, by whom, how, under which conditions, and with which tools?  \\nThe question of how to address these issues is at the heart of studies by scholars of governance. Governance refers to \\"all processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market, or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms, power or language. Governance differs from government in that it focuses less on the state and its institutions and more on social practices and activities.\\" (Bevir, 2012). \\nThis course provides an overview of how society seeks to control, steer, and manage technology and technological change. It will introduce students to critical actors and concepts of governance and technological governance and the role of various actors in this process. Students will learn to answer questions, such as identifying technological change, what role society has in this process, what political, legal, ethical, and social frameworks exist for such governance, and who decides the governance conditions. \\nUsing case studies on the internet, AI technology, and climate change, students will apply the theoretical learnings of this course practically, enabling them to think, engage, and write critically about technology and technological governance. \\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nCLO 1 Students will learn about governance and technological governance, its function and importance in the social sciences.\\nCLO 2 Students will scientifically research on governance, technological change and tech governance. \\nCLO 3 Students will present their research output in written form and through presentations.\\nCLO 4 Students will learn, understand and analyze how society react, and (seeks to) control technology and its impact. \\nCLO 5 Students will be able to apply the course learnings into their own life and Vietnamese society, and understand societal needs and reactions to technology and technological change.\\nCLO 6 Students will gain further broader learning about political sciences, sociology and science, technology and society studies.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nBlock 1: Introduction.\\nWeek 01: Course Introduction.\\nWeek 02: Understanding governance.\\nWeek 03: Understanding technological governance.\\n\\nBlock 2: Actors of governance.\\nWeek 04: The role of governments in technological governance.\\nWeek 05: The role of commercial actors in technological governance.\\nWeek 06: The role of society in technological governance.\\n\\nBlock 3 Influences of technological change and its impact on technological governance.\\nWeek 07 Equality or inequality?

The past three decades have seen Vietnam increasingly rising as a political as well as economic power in the Southeast Asian region. Given its growing economic size and political influence, Vietnam\u2019s regional footprint is progressively noticeable. This course helps students understand how politics, history, culture, and customs could have an impact on the rapidly changing economy and society in contemporary Vietnam. It will focus on the discussion how political, economic and social forces shape a \u201csocialism-oriented market economy\u201d as the Vietnamese government claims. Put simply, the primary focus is on the interrelationships among individuals, governments, and public policy. The course is organized into two broad primary portions: 1) The history of Vietnam and the Vietnam\u2019s economic renovation (Doi Moi) since 1986; and 2) Contemporary issues the country is facing. This first part will only capture the key periods and turning points in historical Vietnam, which is necessary for understanding how historical institutions continue to shape the nation\u2019s politics and economy today. The remainder of the course will be on the Vietnamese economic reform since 1986 and contemporary issues, with an emphasis on the relationship between politics and economic development, plus cross-country comparisons as well as key challenges facing the Vietnamese Communist Party leadership, such as regime stability, pollution, and political reform.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\\nAt the end of this course, the ultimate objectives of this course are that students should have a familiarity with and knowledge of \\nVietnam from the interplay of the so-called socialist ideology and \u201csocialism-oriented market economy,\u201d \\nThe hierarchical structure and decision-making process of the Vietnamese government, \\nThe distinctive dynamic of politics, economy, and legal system in Vietnam, and how it differs from other western models. \\nThe course improves students\u2019 ability to think about Vietnam\u2019s complex development more comprehensively and critically; and \\nIt also enables students to integrate what they have learned into other Vietnam-related courses in their chosen academic (inter-)discipline(s).\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\nThe final grade shall be determined as follows:\\nAttendance 10%\\nParticipation in discussions 10%\\nBi-weekly responses 40% (10% each)\\nFinal group project (40%) ","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"16:15:00"}],"location":"Ting Foundation"},{"title":"Theory & Method in Vietnam Studies","id":"VS205_Spring2024_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Nicolas Weber","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdjKdQAI/vs205spring2024s01","description":"Faculty: Vu Minh Hoang\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nPre-requisite: Completion of CORE102 Modern Vietnamese Culture and Society.

Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Students will be exposed to \u201cVietnamese Studies\u201d currently practiced inside and outside Vietnam to realize which approaches have been employed in this interdisciplinary field, and how the field significantly varies in different geo-political, socio-cultural environments, depending on who is doing it and in which contexts it is carried out. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. Finally, students will have a chance to redefine \u201cVietnam Studies\u201d at Fulbright University Vietnam and figure out which directions it is heading towards. This course is open to VS majors and non-majors.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes: Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:\\nBecome aware of the work of leading scholars/experts from Vietnam and overseas;\\nContextualize Vietnam in regional/area studies;\\nLocate various (re)sources for their understanding of and research on Vietnam;\\nApply transdisciplinary approaches to their research\\n---\\nPossible Assessments & Grading:\\nAttendance & Participation: 20%\\nExploring e-resources for Vietnam Studies report: 20%\\nPrimary source analysis: 20%\\nFinal Essay: 40%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom "},{"title":"Cultural and Intellectual Foundation of Vietnamese Literary Chinese II","id":"VS206_Spring2024_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Phan Thu Van","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002fdjKfQAI/vs206spring2024s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Phan Thu Van - E: van.phan@fulbright.edu.vn\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nPre-requisite: VS106 Cultural and Intellectual Foundation of Vietnamese Literary Chinese 1.\\n* Cross-listed with Literature (LIT)\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nVietnamese Literary Chinese is an important part of the formation of Vietnamese culture and ideology. Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts.\\nNowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular. Based on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes: Having finished this course, students will:\\n1. Have basic knowledge of Vietnamese Literary Chinese (writing, reading, grammar)\\n2. Attain a vocabulary of 800 words of Vietnamese Literary Chinese.\\n3. Gain the ability to read poems or tales in Vietnamese Literary Chinese.\\n4.

In this course, it will be examined from a secular perspective. Taught in a pre-seminar teaching format that combines lectures with in-class discussions, the course employs an interdisciplinary approach that allows students to understand this concept/practice through a variety of lenses, such as history, culture, and applied psychology. Following this direction, Secular mindfulness will be examined historically to see the formation, reconstruction, and transmission of it from wartime Vietnam to the world and back to postwar developing Vietnam. Moreover, during this course, students will have the chance to practice mindfulness and reflect on it in familial, communal, national, and international contexts. In addition to equipping students with academic understanding of and scholarly approaches to secular mindfulness, mindfulness practices introduced in the course may also help students build and develop a healthy mental lifestyle.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (Vietnam Studies)\\nRECOGNIZE that historical and cultural heritage, as well as regional and global contexts, are all essential to understanding Vietnam; As for Psychology Major (PM), students will be able to examine Mindfulness using major concepts, theoretical perspectives, historical trends, and empirical findings in psychology.\\nPERFORM close-readings and critical interpretations of texts and other media authored by local and international scholars, writers, and cultural producers; As for PM, students will be able to work with their peers in Vietnam Studies (VS) to interpret, design, and conduct interdisciplinary research that incorporates basic psychological approach.\\nCOMMUNICATE and COLLABORATE effectively in intercultural environments; As for PM, students should be able to incorporate sociocultural factors in their psychological research.\\nFORMULATE and CONDUCT substantial independent research projects; As for PM, students will be able to apply ethical standards to understand secular mindfulness.\\nAPPLY interdisciplinary skills and methods to address contemporary issues and become active citizens in Vietnamese society.\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (Psychology)\\nStudents will be able to apply psychological principles to behavioral phenomena through effective written and oral communication of the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, historical trends, and empirical findings in Psychology.\\nStudents will be able to interpret, design, and conduct basic psychological research.\\nStudents will be able to incorporate sociocultural factors in scientific inquiry when appropriate.\\nStudents will be able to apply ethical standards to evaluate and engage in psychological science and practice.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek 1\\nThich Nhat Hanh\u2019s Engaged Buddhism and Inter-Being\\nReading:\\nPaul Fuller, An Introduction to Engaged Buddhism, London & New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2022, Chapter 1: \u201cIntroduction: Engaged Buddhism,\u201d 1-21.\\nThich Nhat Hanh, \u201cHistory of Engaged Buddhism: A Dharma Talk by Thich Nhat Hanh- Hanoi, Vietnam, May 6-7, 2008,\u201d Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self - Knowledge; Belmont Vol. 6, Iss. 3 (Summer 2008): 29-36.\\nMichael C.

At the same time, Cold War remnants (a divided Korea and China) and major geopolitical shifts (the rise of China and India, decline of US and Japan) contribute significantly to the volatility of our world. This course will examine the political, economic, and geopolitical dynamism of the region through a survey of relations among the great powers in East Asia from the sixteenth century to the present. Special emphasis will be given to regional and global developments from the perspective of the four principal East Asian states\u2014China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam. We will explore the many informal, as well as formal, means of intercourse that have made East Asia what it is today.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\n(CLO1) History: Students will develop a broad grasp of East Asian diplomacy and a deep understanding of specific events and historical figures.  \\n(CLO2) Reading: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources and between scholarly and non-scholarly texts. They will also learn to critically evaluate texts. \\n(CLO3) Expression: Students will hone their skills in both written and oral expression. \\n(CLO4) Interpretation: Students will recognize competing narratives and make judgments about such narratives through context and appreciation of historical contingency. \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus:\\nWeek I Introduction \\nNo Readings \\n\\nWeek II \u201cChinese World Order\u201d \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Intro, Chps. 1, 5: Origins; Mature Trajectories (pp. 1-30; 132-49) \\nSpence, The Question of Hu, Chps. 1-3 (pp. 3-43) \\nPrimary: *\u201cThe Imperial Order and Han Syntheses\u201d (2nd cent, BCE), pp. 283-92 \\nWeek III Korean and Japanese appropriation of Chinese World Order (14th-17th cent) \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chps. 5, 6: Confucian Korea; Warrior Japan; Reunification Japan (pp.149-66; 187-94) \\nSpence, The Question of Hu, Chps. 4-8 (pp. 44-104) \\nPrimary: *\u201cAdmonition to the New King\u201d (1392), pp. 274-6 \\n*Ronald Toby, \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass of Protocol,\u201d pp. 168-197 \\n\\nWeek IV East Meets West: Canton (18th century), \u201ctreaty port\u201d system (19th century) \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chps. 6, 8: Ming, Qing China; 19th Century Encounter; Treaty Ports (pp. 167-83; 217-25; 230-2) \\nSpence, The Question of Hu, Chps. 9-11 (pp. 105-34) \\nPrimary: *\u201cLd Macartney\u2019s Cmmssn from Henry Dundas,\u201d etc. (1792-3), pp. 92-109 \\n*\u201cMemorial on Legalizing Opium (1836), pp. 110-4 \\n Week V Treaty port in Japan and Korea (to 1880s) \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chps. 6, 8: Hermit Kingdom; World Upside Down; 19th Century Opening of Korea; Meiji Restoration (pp. 183-6; 195-8; 235-8; 240-4) \\nCai, Miscellany of the South Seas, pp. 14-44 \\nPrimary: *\u201dDebates over Open J\u201d (Tokugawa Nariaki, Ii Naosuke [1853]), pp. 281-8 \\n*Kim Okkyun, \u201cKapsin Reform Edict\u201d (1884), p. 995-6 \\n\\nWeek VI 19th Century Border Crossings \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chp. 8: Domestic Rebellions; Tongzhi Restoration; Meiji Restoration (225-30; 244-51) \\nCai, Miscellany, pp. 47-109 \\nPrimary: *\u201cJournal of Townsend Harris\u201d (1857-8), pp. 117-22 \\n*\u201cYung Wing advises the Taiping and Zeng Guofan\u201d (1859, 63), pp. 150-4 \\n\\nWeek VII Japanese and American Empires (latter 19th century) \\nReadings: \\nHolcombe, Chp. 8: 19th Century Opening of Korea (pp. 238-40) \\nCai, Miscellany, pp. 111-32 \\nPrimary: *Min Yonghwan, \u201cOne Policy out of a Thousand\u201d (1894), pp. 26-34 \\n*Alfred T.
