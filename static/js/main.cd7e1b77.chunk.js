They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\\nSample Topic Schedule\\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\\n1.

We will also explore important technical and theoretical concepts associated with the moving image, such as editing, dialectic, representation, and protest. We will cover basic narrative structure and script writing, but will go beyond traditional understandings of moving image-based production to explore more experimental modes of storytelling and filmic practice. The course will emphasize practical engagement with ideas and theories through process and presentation, so hands-on production and formal presentation of work will be prioritized. Course assessments will consist of two key projects: one based on found footage and the other using original shot footage. A core component of these assessments will be presentation and engagement on critique days.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nDemonstrate a basic understanding of the video making process.\\nDevelop comprehension of non-linear editing concepts and practical competency in the usage of non-linear video-editing software. \\nDevelop skills in basic script writing format and an understanding of filmic narrative structure.\\nDemonstrate competency in oral presentation and studio critique.\\nAcquire introductory knowledge of seminal video artworks and experimental films.\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance and Participation:15%\\nVideo Project, Individual: One video with duration of less than 5-minutes made using only found footage. 30%\\nPresentation and critique session for 5-minute video. 10%\\nFinal video project, Individual: One final video with duration of less than 10 minutes, using footage shot by the student. 35%\\nPresentation and critique session for 10-minute video final project. 10%","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}]},{"title":"Special Topics in Contemporary Art: Post-Asia","id":"ARTS301_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Pamela Corey","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NgQAJ/arts301fall2021s01","description":"Faculty: Pamela Corey - E: pamela.corey@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite or Co-requisite: ARTS101 \u2013 Introduction to Visual Studies.

Instead of geographically mapping these practices and artists by nation or region, we will examine selected case studies and specific artworks through such thematic and conceptual topics as the Body, Painting, Technology, Archive, Scale, and Voice. What this structuring offers is a way of understanding contemporary art as intellectually conditioned, transnationally networked, and as something embedded in both national and global economic and political developments. In addition, close examination of individual artists and artworks will afford us a deeper understanding of how Asian artists have navigated and continue to navigate the specificities of local histories, sensorial encounters with changing materials, forms, and sites, and the complexities of identity and belonging. Today, as we progress further into what has been projected to be \'the Asian century\', the term \u2018Post-Asia\u2019 thus encourages us to think about the changing context and imagination of Asia as it informs critical analyses and representations of contemporary art in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and offers modes of resisting cultural tropes problematically rooted in the \u2018East vs West\u2019 binary.\\nThis introductory course is required for all Art and Media Studies majors.

The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives\\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\\n---\\nCourse Materials:\\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas.

Through the Fulbright Scholar Development program, these students will earn 4 credits, equivalent to one full-time course, as they complete this academic internship. \\nThese student scholars will engage in a variety of tasks and activities intended to provide them with a holistic academic experience. Much of the experience will revolve around the delivery of the course Principles of Economics I. Student scholars will create materials, support lectures, run tutorials, aid with experiments, and participate in weekly meetings and online discussions.  \\nIn addition to running this course with Graeme, student scholars will also have the opportunity to develop their own research ideas based on lessons from the course. For each topic covered in Principles of Economics I, student scholars will be given additional readings and resources intended to deepen their knowledge on the topic and provoke research ideas. \\nAt the end of the Fall term, student scholars will submit either a literature review or project proposal. Student scholars will also have to complete a reflection on the experience. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: By the end of the Fall term, student scholars will be able to:\\n\u2022 clearly communicate theoretical and methodological approaches to economic issues\\n\u2022 use strategies and instructional methods to effectively lead small groups in discussions and activities\\n\u2022 formulate research questions founded in economic theory\\n\u2022 evaluate and test theoretical models\\n\u2022 analyze and interpret experimental data\\n---\\nExpected Workload:\\nStudent scholars will begin working with Graeme during the week of September 27, 2021 to help prepare for the delivery of the course Principles of Economics I. From the week of September 27 to October 15, student time will be divided between meetings, workshops, and course set-up as follows:\\nMeetings (2 hrs/week): Meetings during these three weeks will be devoted to getting organized and checking in on progress with activities related to setting up the course. Each week there will be a one-hour meeting with all students as well as meetings with sub-groups of students working on different aspects of the course.\\nWorkshops (2 hrs/week): Each week we will hold a two-hour teaching workshop where students will lead portions of lessons or activities that they have helped develop. During these sessions, all students will participate and Graeme will provide feedback on the delivery of the lessons/activities. The goal of these workshops is to help students become comfortable leading small groups through online activities.\\nCourse Set-up (6 hrs/week): Student scholars may be asked to update slides, create reading lists, develop homework documents, and set-up Canvas. Student scholars will be assigned various topics from the course and asked to work either individually or in small groups to ensure all materials needed for the course are ready before the Fall term begins. Once the Fall term begins, from the week of October 17, 2021 until January 14, 2022, student scholars will be spend their time in class, meetings, office hours, and on research-related activities, as follows:\\nClass Time (3 hrs/week): Principles of Economics I will have class on Monday and Wednesday. Each session will run for 90 minutes. Monday\u2019s session will be run by Graeme while Wednesday\u2019s session will be primarily run by student scholars as tutorials. These tutorials will primarily address the weekly homework, but may also involve discussion-based activities that student scholars will facilitate.\\nMeetings (2 hr/week): We will meet once per week for two hours. During this time we will debrief on the week\u2019s lecture and tutorial, prepare for the following week\u2019s lesson, and discuss the related literature on the coming topics.\\nOffice Hours (1 hr/week): Each student scholar will be required to hold one office hour per week. During these times, students from Principle of Economics I can ask questions related to their weekly homework.\\nResearch (4 hrs/week): Each week, student scholars will engage in research activities related to a topic from the coming lesson. The goal is to give the student scholar a deeper understanding of some of the research on a specific topic. For example, in the second week we will discuss capitalism as an economic system. The specific research we may investigate could be based on studies comparing contemporary economic behaviour in the former countries of East and West Germany.\\nWeekly research activities may include, but are not limited to, constructing bibliographies, engaging in online discussion groups, presenting readings, and analyzing data. Online discussion groups will allow student scholars to collaborate on weekly research topics to organize readings and share important findings. Student scholars may be asked to present some of what they have learned during weekly meetings.\\nBy the end of the week of January 14, 2022, student scholars will have to submit either a project proposal or literature review as well as a reflection.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading: Pass/No Pass","categories":["EL"],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Modern East Asia","id":"HIS104_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Mark Frank","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NiQAJ/his104fall2021s01","description":"Faculty: Mark Frank - E: mark.frank@fulbright.edu.vn \\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No.\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\nCross-listed: History (HIS), Vietnamese Studies (VS)\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course covers East Asian History from 1600 to the present with a focus is on the tumultuous 19th and 20th centuries, when China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam underwent rapid social and political transformations in response to unprecedented internal and external pressures. Our goal is to develop a deep understanding of key historical \u2018moments\u2019, such as the Opium War and the Meiji Restoration, and the ability to situate those moments in the greater context of East Asian history. Lectures will be broad in scope while readings will be more narrowly focused. The course format will alternate between lecture and open-ended discussion. The course is structured in four major units as follows:\\nUnit 1: East Asian Order from 1600-1839\\nUnit 2: Crisis and Adaptation (1839-1895)\\nUnit 3: A New Balance of Power (1895-1945)\\nUnit 4: Rebuilding after World War II (1945-present)\\nLearning Objectives: Students will develop knowledge, skills, and mindsets as follows:\\nKnowledge: Students will develop a broad understanding of the contours of modern East Asian history and a deep understanding of certain events and figures.\\nSkills: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources as well as between scholarly and non-scholarly sources, and they will develop an ability to critically evaluate texts by referring to other sources and by drawing on the knowledge they acquire in this course.\\nMindsets: Students will contemplate past ways of thinking about morality, politics, and religion in East Asia in order to make sense of the region\'s history.

Like many of the explorers you will meet along the way, you will travel across time from when Chinggis Khan\u2019s armies conquered China and Baghdad in the 13th century and the Black Death scoured the Eurasian world a century later right up to the globalization of our day. Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age? How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. The aim of this course is to understand the big forces that pull the world\u2019s parts together as well as those that drive them apart. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects you to students elsewhere in the world. Across 22 locations around the world, students are taking the same course simultaneously and posting and sharing their ideas on the course Gallery site.\\n---\\nLectures: All lectures are pre-recorded and online. Two weekly lectures will be posted every Friday night at 22:00 EDT on Canvas. You must watch these lectures BEFORE your weekly team meeting. Each lecture is about an hour long.

It has left no one untouched. It has disrupted national economies, global supply chains and international travel. It has sharply exposed social, economic and political inequity around the world. It has upended international norms of behaviour and highlighted the inadequacy of global institutions to promote sound health policies to protect the most vulnerable and effectively stop the spread of the virus. This is a problem-based, interdisciplinary social sciences course that addresses these issues and sets out to answer the question: What lessons can the global community learn from the Covid-19 pandemic? Over the duration of this course, students will work together to answer this question, watching short video presentations online, doing weekly readings and engaging in synchronous and asynchronous online learning activities and discussions with the instructor and their fellow classmates. In doing so, students will collaboratively seek solutions to the inter- and transnational problems that have emerged from the pandemic such as: What is the proper balance to strike between saving lives and saving the economy? How can the global community address the social, economic and political inequality that has made the effects of the pandemic so much worse for certain populations in the world? How can global institutions be strengthened to promote international cooperation and effective health policies to prevent future pandemics?\\n---\\n Learning Outcomes: On completion of this course, you will be able to:\\nDefine the social, economic and political challenges faced by the global community during the Covid-19 pandemic\\nExplain how international institutions responded to the Covid-19 pandemic\\nIdentify the social, economic and political lessons learned by the global community from the Covid-19 pandemic\\nPropose global policies to address the health and welfare problems posed by future pandemics\\nClearly articulate your ideas in written and oral form\\n---\\nClass Schedule:\\nLearning Materials\\nVideo presentations \u2013 YouTube and other online videos assigned by the instructor or identified by students investigating and issue.\\nWeb-based material assigned by the instructor or identified by students investigating an issue.\\nReadings \u2013 articles and chapters found online or posted by the instructor as well as material identified by students investigating and issue.\\nWeek 1:\\nIntroduction to the Course: Defining the Problem\\nAs a class we will meet to determine a strategy to determine the lessons to be learned from the Covid-19 Pandemic.

The course starts with pre-modern and early modern theorists from East and West like Thucydides, Confucius, Machiavelli, Grotius, Kant, and Hobbes. We go on to explore the development of the first modern International Relations theories at the turn of the 20th century, including Marxism, Classical Liberalism, Classical Realism. We then retrace how Neo-Liberalism and Neo-Realism fought for dominance during the Cold War. Finally, we get to the present era where Critical Theory, Constructivism, Neo-Functionalism, and Intergovernmentalism are now challenging older paradigms and bringing new voices to the International Relations debate. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be introduced to the most influential International Relations theories.\\nStudents will apply their knowledge of the historical, socio-political, and personal context behind the development of International Relations theories to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each school of thought.\\nStudents will apply this knowledge to analyze present-day problems in international relations.\\nStudents will develop critical thinking and argumentative writing skills to synthesize their own philosophy of international relations.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule & Readings:\\nRecommended background reading, especially for students unfamiliar with world history: Paul Kennedy, Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\\nWeek#: Introduction\\nIntroduction to the course\\nWeek#: Confucius and Mencius in pre-imperial China\\nHow did the political fragmentation of China during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period shape Confucius\u2019 and Mencius\u2019 ideas about inter-state relations?\\nYuri Pines, Foundations of Confucian Thought, Introduction, Chapter 4\\nDavid Kang, \u201cHierarchy and Legitimacy in International Systems: The Tribute System in Early Modern East Asia\u201d; Sungmoon Kim, \u201cMencius on International Relations and the morality of war: From the perspective of Confucian \u2018Moralpolitik\u2019\u201d\\nWeek#: Thucydides in Classical Greece\\nDid Thucydides really believe in \u201cThucydides\u2019 Trap\u201d?\\nGraham Allison, \u201cThe Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China Headed for War?\u201d https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/; James Lee, \u201cDid Thucydides Believe in Thucydides\u2019 Trap?\u201d\\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, Chapters I-V, XVII-XVIII, XXIII https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7142/7142-h/7142-h.htm\\nWeek#: Machiavelli in the Italian Renaissance\\nTo what extent was Machiavelli \u201cMachiavellian\u201d?\\nJames Hankins, Virtue Politics: Soulcraft and Statecraft in Renaissance Italy, Chapters I-III\\nNiccol\xf2 Machiavelli, The Prince https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm; Discourses on Livy, Book II http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10827/pg10827-images.html\\nWeek#: Grotius vs. Selden in the Age of Discovery\\nHow did imperial rivalry in the 17th century shape the foundations of the modern Law of the Sea?\\nPeter Borschberg, \u201cThe Seizure of the Sta.

Over 36 million people had died, 19 million of whom were civilians. Economic devastation stalked the continent, violent score-settling was common, and near-anarchy reigned in many places. As Europeans came to terms with war and began rebuilding society they looked to legal institutions to take account of atrocities, punish (or forgive) perpetrators, and develop new ideas of justice, accountability, political liberty, and civil rights. Starting with the Nuremberg tribunal, Europeans have used (and abused) court trials to reshape the political, social, and cultural landscape of the continent. As such, trials provide an excellent lens through which to observe how Europeans confronted the most difficult controversies of their time: wartime atrocities, genocide, Stalinism, decolonization, torture, authoritarianism, the fall of Communism, postcolonial immigration, European integration, and the role of religious extremism. This course looks at \u201ctrials\u201d real and conceptual to chart European history from 1945 to the present. Using primary sources such as original court transcripts and witness testimonies, students will examine trials for war crimes and treason, military tribunals and \u201cshow\u201d trials, trials of terrorists and \u201ccounter-terrorists,\u201d as well as contemporary human rights trials. They will also look at how Europeans frequently took matters into their own hands to put the past itself on trial through vigilante justice, the construction or destruction of historical monuments, and the burial and reburial of controversial historical figures. In particular, students will investigate how the same events were tried and retried, their histories told and retold over time as a gauge of Europe\u2019s changing political landscape.\\n\u201cEurope on Trial\u201d is designed to give Fulbright students a deeper understanding of political, social, and cultural systems beyond Vietnam. At first glance, contemporary Europe looks very different from Vietnam. Yet peace and democratic governance are recent phenomena for Europeans\u2014the ghosts of war, occupation, and authoritarianism still haunt their societies and, as in Vietnam, Europeans also struggle to reassess their past in the face of multi-generational trauma. Students taking this course will witness how and why Europeans have constantly reexamined their past. In so doing, they will better understand Europe\u2019s present and gain a framework for analyzing more universal questions of balancing order with civil liberties, justice, and power beyond the European continent. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUnderstand the historical context, political debates, and socio-cultural transformations that occurred in Europe since 1945.\\nCompare and contrast how various postwar European political and legal systems deployed the law to address issues of justice, security, democracy, religion, and historical memory.\\nAnalyze critically visual, textual, literary, legal, and archival documentation.\\nEvaluate primary and secondary sources to address fundamental questions of historical change in Europe since 1945.\\nCraft evidence-based argumentation through written assignments that address the historical role of political systems on law and law on political systems in Europe since the end of the Second World War.\\n---\\nCourse Outline: Link\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\n1.

These include intimate relationships, sexuality, leadership, work, teams, environmental problems, popular culture, body image, digital gaming, social media, addiction and the conflict between traditional values and modern lifestyles. These topics will be explored in relation to our sense of self and identity, social interactions, intergroup relationships, how people develop knowledge of the world and the situated nature of human existence. The course assumes that social psychology is more than a spectator sport by making links between theory, research and action. Guiding such work is the proposition that human beings have innate dignity and should be afforded equitable chances to flourish in life.\\n---\\nSyllabus\\nSession 01: Introduction to Applied Social Psychology\\nReadings:\\nHodgetts, D., Stolte, O., Sonn, C., Drew, N., Carr, S., & Nikora, L.

It begins by examining what means to represent (literally, re-present) or \u201ctell about\u201d social life, the various ways this has been and can be done, and the challenges we face in doing so in a way that brings value to the social settings and relations within which we work and live. It does so first by examining and comparing various genres of social representation and then distinguishing the social sciences as a distinctive if internally diverse set of approaches to understanding aspects of \\"society\\" or social life. To do this, the course offers a comparative introduction to traditions of social inquiry spanning the fields of sociology, political economy, economics, \\"political science,\\" and anthropology. Finally, the course considers the value and limitations of single-discipline only approaches to understanding the social world and the promise and challenges of a more transdisciplinary approach.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to: \\nExplain in generic terms what it means to \u201ctell about\u201d or \u201crepresent\u201d \u201csociety.\u201d\\nDistinguish social sciences from other genres of social representation.\\nMake distinctions among major traditions of inquiry and ideas in the social sciences.\\nGenerate questions and analyze issues from different disciplinary perspectives.\\nBring multiple social scientific and other perspectives on a social issue of interest. \\n---\\nCourse Outline\\n1.

Ethnography refers to both a process of doing ethnography and a written product. In doing ethnography, a researcher actively participates in the group in order to gain an insider\u2019s perspective of the group and to have experiences similar to the group members. In writing ethnography, a researcher narrates observations of the group based on this participation, interviews with group members, and an analysis of group documents and artifacts. This course is designed to provide students with an overview of ethnography and the ethnographic research process, including formulating research questions, finding sources and data, evaluating and critiquing qualitative data including field notes and interview transcripts, and writing an ethnographic report. The course explores crucial aspects of preparing for, realizing and evaluating ethnographic fieldwork.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\nAppraise the quality of ethnographic research;\\nAppreciate the role personal and theoretical knowledge play in conducting ethnographic research;\\nComprehend the way ethnographic data is collected and interpreted; and,\\nWrite and present ethnographic research reports.\\n---\\nAssessments:\\nClass participation (20%)\\nMidterm quiz/exam (20%)\\nResearch Project Presentation (10%)\\nResearch findings presentations (20%)\\nFinal essay (30%)","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}]},{"title":"Foundations of Political Economy","id":"SOCI201_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Jonathan London","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NtQAJ/soci201fall2021s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Jonathan London - E: TBA\\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: Online\\nCross-listed: Social Sciences (SOCI), Economics (ECON)\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course provides students a rigorous introduction to key ideas, concepts, theories, and problems in classical and contemporary political economy and demonstrates their value for exploring, understanding, and explaining economies and economic aspects of social life in a variety of settings. Drawing on a sociological approach, the course emphasizes political economy\u2019s social foundations and seeks to equip students with the ideas and skills needed to develop an informed analysis of some the most important social, political, economic, and cultural debates of our times. Rather than endorsing any one perspective on economy and society, the course surveys and combines multiple perspectives, drawing from ideas and concepts from various intellectual traditions spanning the fields of economics, sociology, politics, and anthropology. The course explores the strengths and weaknesses of these various traditions. In doing so, the course invites students to appreciate that, whatever our preferred explanatory frame or favored theory may be, no single perspective or intellectual standpoint is likely to be wholly sufficient for understanding or explaining actually existing economies. Rather than dwelling on abstractions, the course addresses real world problems and themes.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nExplain key concepts and theoretical approaches in classical, contemporary political economy.\\nDevelop comparative perspectives on course themes addressed in a variety of settings.\\nCollect and use data to make or explore claims about variety of political economy themes.\\nCompare features of Vietnam\u2019s economy with other countries in the region and the world.\\n---\\nCourse Outline:\\n1.

One can wake up, grab their phone, catch up with news and friends from around the world, all before leaving the bed. For all humans spending their lives in towns, villages, and cities, from one side of the world to another, most of us spend much of our lives in cyberspace. The meaning of \u201cgoing there\u201d has changed, and the Internet is fundamental to that change. We log into the Internet, go online, visit websites, surf the web, navigate pages, and so forth. Even the language we use to talk about the Internet is one of travel, of spatial belonging and exploration. This course considers how the Internet, and in particular, online communities and cyberspace are redefining what it means to be human. As much as this is a course about digital belonging, this is also a course of digital belonging. Through a reflexive analysis of our digital connectivity within the class, we can challenge our own assumptions about what it means to exist in digital spaces. Some online spaces we will explore are Social Media Influencers, E-Sports, Online Forums (including parenting, suicide, and dating), Hacktivism, Wikipedia, and, of course, Facebook. Some theoretical concepts we explore are social theories of modernization, materiality, actor network theory, social capital, identity, space, virtuality, the state, and surveillance. This course offers a general introduction to social science and anthropological research methods, and theories, with a specific emphasis on cultures of and in new media (internet, mobile phone, etc.). As a final project, students will develop and conduct a mini-ethnography of an online community of their choosing.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: By the end of this class, students will be able to:\\nDesign and produce an ethnographic text through writing a mini-ethnography which includes a literature review section\\nApply qualitative anthropological methods to analyze communication and community over new media.\\nUnderstand core concepts in digital anthropology\\nSelect, read, and synthesize secondary sources based on research interests\\nReflect upon their own online experiences and identity formation.\\n---\\nReading Guides\\nReading guides are available to help you work with these texts. They are optional but highly recommended.

A prevailing perception regards Asian women \u2013 especially those highly educated or from powerful families \u2013 as socio-politically as well or even better than their male counterparts. Yet there is little understanding of the history, nature, and challenge of Asian women\u2019s struggle to exercise their political agency. This course offers students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of women and politics in Asia and to explore the significance of gender in politics of the past, present, and future. The course also examines various factors, trajectories and outcomes of women\u2019s political advancement in contemporary Asia. This course aims to familiarize students with a broad range of issues involving women and politics in Asia \u2013 the political participation of women; the history of women\u2019s movements; political divisions among women; and what we mean when we refer to \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d at home, at work, and in political institutions. Because women\u2019s involvement in the political arena is informed by their roles and status at home and in society at large, the course will also examine sociological, anthropological, and feminist research on such topics as inequality, power, discrimination, and social norms. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning women in Vietnam and Asia.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\nComprehend various institutional, cultural and personal factors, as well as distinctive trajectories and outcomes of women\u2019s political engagement in Vietnam and Asia;\\nUse basic concepts and theories of women and politics;\\nRead critically the literature and other materials;\\nWrite and present academic research reports; and,\\nReflect upon women in politics and society of Vietnam and Asia.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nClass participation (20%)\\nMidterm quiz/exam (20%)\\nResearch Project Presentation (10%)\\nResearch findings presentations (20%)\\nFinal essay (30%)","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"}]},{"title":"Cultural and Intellectual Foundation of Vietnamese Literary Chinese 1","id":"VS106a_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Phan Thu Van","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NyQAJ/vs106afall2021s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Phan Thu Van - E: van.phan@fulbright.edu.vn \\nLevel: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course helps Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems.

It seeks to examine different theoretical perspectives on social movements and meanwhile exposes students to empirical studies of movements across the world, in both democratic and non-democratic states, with an emphasis on Vietnam. The key questions we will examine include the following: When and why do social movements occur? How are movements organized? What do movement participants think and feel? How do social movements work? How do authorities respond to movements? Why do movements decline? What changes do movements bring about? How do Vietnamese social movements emerge and grow? Any challenges ahead for Vietnamese civil society?\\nThe course will be divided into two main parts. The first devoted to theories of social movements and the ways in which our understanding of social movements has changed over time. We will also examine mobilization to social movements and ask why some people come to participate while others do not as well as the tactics  and successes of various social movements. The second is reserved for discussion of Vietnam\'s nascent social movements. There will be also experiential learning format in the course through which students will have the chance to visit an NGO in Ho Chi Minh City.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the end of this course, the student will be able to:\\nExplain the main theories and concepts used in class.\\nLearn the analytic tools necessary to examine and critically assess the role of social movements in our society.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned in class to better understand historical and modern social movement causes and campaigns.\\nDesign a research project that incorporates a clear hypothesis, literature review, and data analysis on the topic of social movements.\\nCritically analyze and evaluate published research.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned to analyze emerging civil society and social movements in Vietnam\\nDevelop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.\\n---\\nSyllabus\\nCourse Readings: There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Canvas and consist of book chapters and journal articles that either discuss key theoretical paradigms used in the study of social movements and/or apply them to specific social movements.\\n\\nWeek 1: Introduction: Conceptualizing Social Movements\\nTilly, Charles.

Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Web-based talks and conversations with representative scholars in Vietnamese Studies from North America, Europe, East- and Southeast Asia will help students recognize the global aspects of this fascinating academic field. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. At the end of the course, students are encouraged to work in team on a research topic of their choice with transdisciplinary approaches. This course is open to VSM majors and non-majors.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: After finishing this course, students should be able to \\n- Recognize the importance of Vietnam Studies from a variety of perspectives;\\n- Obtain a general view of Vietnam Studies as it is practiced widely and differently in Vietnam as well in the rest of the world, thus get ready for their graduate studies;\\n- Get connected with leading scholars/experts from Vietnam and overseas;\\n- How to contextualize Vietnam in regional/area studies;\\n- How to identify a substantial and meaningful Vietnam-based research topic that can trigger international interests;\\n- Locate various (re)sources for their understanding of and research on Vietnam; \\n- Apply transdisciplinary approaches to their research.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nAttendance & participation (10%)\\nBi-weekly responses (30%)\\n(re)sources survey (20%)\\nFinal team project (40%)","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}]},{"title":"Digital Creative Writing: Lessons from Vietnamese and Non-Vietnamese Writers","id":"VS207_Fall2021_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"\u0110\xe0o L\xea Na","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NxQAJ/vs207fall2021s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Dao Le Na - E: na.dao@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory- Arts & Humanities (C1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nFormat: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: Currently, creative writing is widely applied in many fields. Additionally, creative writing is also an essential subject for those who want to become professional writers as well as share their works through digital platforms. This course accumulates several skills, including reading and analyzing literary works, observations, research, along with in-depth interviews. The core of the course is to help students discover the digital world and how to compose digital texts. Students will be encouraged to think out of the box, explore their favorite creative writing styles, and choose a suitable form for their works and other ones of interactive storytelling in new media. Furthermore, contemporary social issues, historical and cultural issues of Vietnam in the context of globalization are going to be taken as the main themes of students\u2019 works. The course will be joined by both national and international experts, famous writers, such as: Ocean Vuong, Nguyen Thanh Viet, Monique Truong, Suzanne Joinson, Tran Thuy Mai and so on to share their experiences through online platform. Students will combine theoretical knowledge, including reading, analysing literary works, with practical observation gained from a field trip to find their creative materials.

Originated from Buddhism but now practiced out of their Buddhist philosophical/ontological contexts, they seem to establish certain living styles habitually described as \u201cpositive,\u201d or \u201cconscious,\u201d but at the same time, are running the risk of going against what the Buddha taught. Thus, to better understand those concepts and put them back into practice more effectively, one cannot but return to their root which is Buddhism. Buddhist ethics (\u201cethics\u201d here can be simply defined as a system of moral principles) undoubtedly plays a crucial role in Vietnamese moral life.\\nIn Vietnam as well as elsewhere, one of the causes that create generation gaps between parents and children is the fact that they are living with/practicing not the same ethical values. A common ethical ground must be first founded to bridge the gaps, to ensure mutual understanding between the individual and her/his ever-expanded communal networks, starting with the family (as the core of society), to community (such as hamlet or village), nation, and finally to the world (natural world included). With the whole-person education framework, the Fulbright University Viet Nam aims to develop its graduates not only as young promising professionals in their fields, but also as moral citizens who can significantly contribute to society in contemporary Vietnamese and global contexts. Such a goal surely cannot be achieved in the absence of moral principles (or ethics).\\nThrough reading assignments, guest lectures given by Vietnamese and international scholars as well as religious practitioners, and field study trips, students of this course will be exposed to various Buddhist traditions performed in Vietnam, East- and Southeast Asian regions. Films, literature, and newspapers will serve as the main sources for case studies and reference. Service learning is also required as an integral part of the course.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nAfter finishing the course, students should be able to:\\n* Acquire a general understanding of Buddhism and its key concepts, moral values, practices, and movements in various regional settings of East- and Southeast Asia, with a focus on Vietnam.\\n* Identify similarities and differences between Western concepts of \u201cethics\u201d and particular aspects of Buddhist ethics.\\n* Recognize Buddhist ethical values practiced in Vietnam and neighboring countries, and refer to Buddhist moral principles as a reference in their daily life.\\n* Explain the rise, popularity, and importance of certain social practices deeply rooted in Buddhism (such as \u201cMindfulness\u201d or \u201cLoving kindness\u201d) around the world, particularly in contemporary Vietnam.\\n* Appreciate Buddhist ethics as an effective way for self-cultivation to become a whole person, a good citizen, and a responsible professional.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nAttendance & participation (10%)\\nBi-weekly responses (30%)\\nService-learning (20%) \u2013 to be discussed with students\\nFinal team project (40%)","categories":["Core","E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}]}]')},137:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('[{"title":"Introduction to Photography History and Theory","id":"ARTS103_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Tran Vi Chau","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OPQAZ/arts103spring2022s01","description":"Faculty: Tran Vi Chau \u2013 E: chau.tran@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: ARTS101 Introduction to Visual Studies\\nFormat: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: We live today in a world of photographic images. Photography is present in a wide range of practices from avant-garde arts to mass media, from the convention of photo identification to the techniques of surveillance, from photojournalism to selfies and Instagram. Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded. With special attention to the intersection of photography and Vietnamese history, the course will also demonstrate how constellations of power - with regards to class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economy, and geopolitics - influence the practice, dissemination, and preservation of photography in Vietnam today.\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe course is designed to encourage students to: \\n\u2022 Acquire a solid foundation on key theoreticians and artists who have engaged with the medium of photography. \\n\u2022 Adopt an integrated range of flexible, research-led approaches to the studies of photographic history and theories. \\n\u2022 Strengthen key skills in writing, reading, and public engagement necessary for higher-level courses in the Art and Media Studies major as well as related fields.","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"}],"location":"Classroom 6 & 7"},{"title":"Dance and Performance Production","id":"ARTS106_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Alexander Tu Nguyen","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NzQAJ/arts106spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Alexander Tu Nguyen - E: alexander.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite or Co-requisite: No\\nFormat: On-Campus\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course will introduce students to both the theoretical and practical fundamentals of dance, and the ways in which dance performances are produced.

We will look at how narratives fuel various political agendas as well as the many strategies artists and filmmakers use to counter dominant narratives. We will deepen our understanding of these concepts, techniques, and problematics through in-class viewings and discussion of various moving image works, supported by theoretical readings focusing on the role of narrative in literature, film, and art.

A successful investment and fund management strategy, however, takes much more than what we see on Shark Tank. It requires crafting an investment thesis, gaining access to the best deal-flow, conducting due diligence, structuring transactions, and managing portfolio investments right up until exit. Along the way, investors need to navigate the often sensitive and complex interpersonal dynamics between themselves and their entrepreneurs, co-investors, and Limited Partners (LPs), just to name a few.\\n\\nAt the same time, ESG and impact investing is gaining momentum, with some of the world\'s leading fund managers incorporating social, environmental and governance factors into their investment decisions. What does it mean to pursue social and environmental outcomes when investing? Is there a trade-off between social impact and financial returns? We will begin to unpack some of these issues as well.\\n\\nThis course is aimed at students seeking to understand the \'nuts and bolts\' of early-stage investing and impact investing. It will be taught in a highly experiential manner by a current practitioner of early-stage investing in Vietnam. Students will learn the basic terminology, processes and strategies of early-stage investing and will apply them to practical case examples. Students will also hear from a number of guest speakers, including leading investors, entrepreneurs and other experts in the ecosystem, to gain a varied perspective.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the end of this course, students should be able to: \\nUnderstand the basic terminology, actors, processes and strategies of the venture capital industry across its different stages, from investment thesis formulation to due diligence to exit\\nApply this knowledge to real examples, considering the situation from both the investors\' as well as the entrepreneurs\' point of view\\nArticulate investment recommendations through clear and concise investment memorandums\\nExplain the rise of impact investing and ESG investing and its potential implications for the investment industry more broadly\\n---\\nDetailed Sessions Guide\\nSession 1: The entrepreneurial journey \\nRequired Readings:\\n\u201cThe Entrepreneurial Journey\u201d, Stuart Crainer, London Business School  \\n\u201cThe Questions Every Entrepreneur Must Answer\u201d, Amar Bidhe, Harvard Business Review, 1996 \\nSession 2: Structure of the VC industry: Who\u2019s who and how do VCs make money? \\nRequired Readings:\\n\u201cA Day in the Life of a Venture Capitalist\u201d (Stanford Case E-44, January 28, 2013) \\n\u201c16 Definitions on the Economics of VC\u201d, Scott Kupor, Andreessen Horowitz \\n\u201cSix Myths About Venture Capitalists\u201d, Diane Mulcahy, HBS \\nChapter 1 \u201cThe Players\u201d and Chapter 10 \u201cHow Venture Capital Funds Work\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson \\nSession 3: Developing a fund investment thesis \\nRequired Readings:\\nChapter 6 \u201cDefining Your Fund\u2019s Investment Strategy\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani \\nDoes your VC have an investment thesis or a hypothesis?, David Teten and Stephane Nasser, TechCrunch120 \\nCompilation of VC Investment Theses, Alexander Jarvis \\nA Short Guide to Impact Investing, The Case Foundation \\nSession 4: Deal sourcing and initial selection \\nRequired Readings:\\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned About Deal Sourcing, Danielle Morrill \\nHow VCs Source Deals, Allen Latta  \\nIn Defence of the Deck, Bill Gurley  \\nChapter 15 \u201cSourcing Investment Opportunities\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \\nSession 5: Due diligence \\nRequired Readings:\\nChapter 16 \u201cThe Art of Conducting Due Diligence\u201d and Chapter 17 \u201cManagement Team Diligence\u201d and Chapter 18 \u201cDiligence beyond Management\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \\nImpact Due Diligence: Emerging Best Practices, Pacific Community Ventures \\nSession 6: Cap tables and Valuation \\nRequired Readings:\\n\u201cFinancing New Ventures\u201d (HBS Note N9-811-093, March 28, 2011)  \\n\u201cNote on Valuation in Private Company Settings (HBS #9-297-050, April 2002)  \\nChapter 7 \u201cThe Capitalization Table\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \\nSession 7: Term Sheets and Legal  \\nRequired Readings:\\nChapters 3 - 6, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \\nVenture Capital Lexicon, Series A Term Sheet, Singapore Venture Capital ASsociation (SVCA)  \\n\u201cVenture Capital Negotiations: VC versus the Entrepreneur\u201d (HBS # 9-800-170, March 2, 2000) \\nSession 8: What happens after the deal is closed: portfolio management through to exit \\nRequired Readings:\\nHow to Build a Great Startup Board: Part I and II, Reid Hoffman  \\n\u201cThe Secret to Making Board Meetings Suck Less\u201d  \\nMeasuring and Managing Impact: A Practical Guide, EVPA  \\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nClass contribution and attendance (20%) - based on general participation and in class contributions  \\nReflections on in-class dialogues/simulations (30%) \u2013 as mentioned this course will include \u2018dialogues\u2019 and \'simulations\' of parts of the investment process.

The approach propels students to look beyond the class content on the internet for project ideas, which give students ever-increasing exposure to the latest technologies around the world especially the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in product development. Through our own experiences with several PBL-based engineering courses (i.e., Design & Systems Thinking; Sensor, Measurement and Analysis; Integrated Engineering Project) and student-led engineering projects (i.e., E-Dap; Hearty Plant) at Fulbright University Vietnam, we notice that many students\u2019 projects are based on IoT technology. Furthermore, we also notice that in most projects, students have a lot of difficulty in finding a good communication solution for data pipeline between hardware products (e.g., sensors, actuators, controllers, processing units) and software controls (e.g., data acquisition and analysis, transmission of control commands) as illustrated in the following figure. The deficiency in the solution boils down to students\u2019 inadequate exposure to communication protocols and editions of database management system that are customizable and interactable with various control systems and web application servers. \\nIn general, undergraduate students could not develop such a communication solution for their IoT products from the ground up because of course duration, dependency on open-source platforms and insufficient knowledge in IoT technologies. On the contrary, the budget for a normal undergraduate engineering project is not enough to purchase expensive IoT solutions currently available on the market. \\nThese motivate us to propose this independent research project under the advisory of Dr. Truong Trung Kien, one of our Engineering lecturers. The project will focus on researching and developing a consistent, low-cost, student-feasible communication solution, enabling students to remotely control their products, automatically retrieve real-time statistical reports of the system and potentially develop self-monitoring algorithms later. We believe that the learning and experience in this research project will greatly assist us, as well as our engineering peers at Fulbright University Vietnam, to be more confident in developing IoT-based products in future engineering projects. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nIt is expected that after completing this independent research project, the students will be able to: \\n[Strong background] Acquire knowledge in the field of IoT and automation in engineering system with the appropriate breadth and depth in order to solve systematically corresponding engineering problems or to invent, design and build IoT-based engineering products. \\n[Proactive consideration] Design an engineering solution that meet specific needs of FUV engineering students with appropriate consideration of student development, educational environment, market requirements, and economic factors. \\n[Analytical thinking] Identify, analyze, and decompose compose complex engineering problems along with available resources, authentic constraints using principles of computer science and engineering sciences.\\n[Effective communication] Listen actively and present clearly to people with different backgrounds to deliver the proposed engineering solution through oral, written, and visual media. \\n[Productive collaboration] Work effectively and responsibly as an individual and as a member in the research group in an independent research project. \\n[Hands-on experience] Design, configure, test and evaluate the performance of an engineering system that integrates communication protocols of hardware and software of different engineering functionality, automated data acquisition and processing, and remote transmission of control commands\\n---\\nTentative Schedule and Workplan:\\n---\\nProposed artifacts for assessment:\\n1. A report of our research, design, implementation, and learning. \\n2. An architectural diagram of the proposed communication solution. \\n3. A workshop to present our proposed communication solution for engineering-interested students\\nGroup work:\\nTwo members in the current research project will work closely together and be both responsible for the following works: \\n\u2022 Desk research about the chosen topic \\n\u2022 Report of works and findings of the assigned research parts \\n\u2022 Updates of the project progress with faculty supervisor \\n\u2022 Completion of proposed artifacts \\nEach member will be mainly in charge of leading the following parts: \\nPham Hoang Lan:\\nResearch of suitable technological platforms for the aiming solution \\nConnections and communications between hardware and software protocols \\nSummary report of the research project \\nPhan Ngoc Lan Khanh:\\nResearch of suitable database management system for the aiming solution \\nAutomated data processing and transmission of control commands to the system \\nFeatures of sample interface presenting the transition of data and control signal from hardware to software and vice versa \\nThe students will be assessed based on their performance on the individually assigned tasks.

It has swung wildly from the liberal internationalism of the Obama administration to the America First nationalism of the Trump administration back to the more cooperative globalism of the Biden administration. How are we to make sense of this? What can Vietnamese leaders do to manage their relations with the US? This interdisciplinary online course examines the US position in the world in a contemporary and historical context to answer these questions. Over the duration of this course, we will examine how the United States has engaged with other peoples, nations and global forces; how other peoples and nations have seen the United States in the world; and how global forces have shaped the United States. By the end of the term, you will be able to explain American global behaviour and suggest ways in which other countries like Vietnam should engage with the United States in the global arena. This course will be divided into three units that build off one another to develop your understanding of the US in the World. In the first unit, we will examine the Cold War and how it shaped the American perception of its global role in the twentieth century. In the second unit, we will go back to the end of the nineteenth century to examine how the United States engaged with the people of the Global South, proceeding through the mid-point of the twentieth century when the global forces of decolonization intersected with the Cold War to push the United States into foreign entanglements, like Vietnam\u2019s war for independence and unification. In the third unit we will consider how the combined experiences of the Cold War and responding to decolonization set the stage for contemporary American global politics and what this means for the relations other nations have with the United States government in the twenty-first century.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\\n1. Identify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\\n2. Explain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\\n3. Explain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\\n4. Explain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\\n5.

Who gets to make Vietnamese foreign policy, and what are they doing to assert Vietnamese sovereignty in the South China Sea (East Sea), dealing with climate change, and securing Covid vaccines? Developed in dialogue with the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam and active and retired Vietnamese diplomats, History of Vietnamese Diplomacy invites the students to walk in the footsteps of the lucky few who have shaped Vietnam\u2019s place in the world from 1945 to the present day, through collection and examination of rare and valuable historical documents and oral histories for classwork and independent research.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\nStudents will be introduced to research methodologies in the field of diplomatic history\\nStudents will gain knowledge in Vietnamese diplomatic history\\nStudents will be introduced to key online and off-line resources for the study of Vietnamese diplomatic history\\nStudents will independently learn to conduct literature reviews and write annotated bibliographies\\nStudents will come up with a proposal for a research project in Vietnamese diplomatic history\\nStudents will learn to peer-review each other\'s works and research collaboratively\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nScaffolded assignments including: reading responses, a literature review, an annotated bibliography, a research proposal, and a short research paper.","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"}],"location":"Classroom 6 & 7"},{"title":"Research Seminar: America\u2019s Nuclear Age: The United States, Nuclear Weapons and","id":"HIS303_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Matthew Jones","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002HzUD6QAN/his303spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Matthew Jones - E: matthew.jones@fulbright.edu.vn \\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: Completion of Global History Lab and/or Fulbright History Lab\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCourse Format: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course looks at the way nuclear weapons and the challenges they have posed have influenced the course of American foreign and defence policy, strategic thinking, and domestic politics, from the instigation of the Manhattan project \u2013 the US program to develop an atomic bomb \u2013 to the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s and a little beyond. Consideration will also be given to the influence of the \u2018nuclear age\u2019 on US cultural and social trends. The course will examine the political and moral dilemmas raised by the possession and possible use of nuclear weapons, the role they have played in the way the United States pursued its policies during the years of Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union and People\u2019s Republic of China, and the domestic political controversies that US nuclear policies engendered. In the latter area we will consider the rise of anti-nuclear grass roots activism in the United States, alongside the place of nuclear issues in presidential elections and Congressional politics. We will also necessarily study some of the major events and crises of the Cold War, including the Berlin crises of 1948, 1958/9 and 1961, the course of the Korean War, and the Cuban missile crisis. The last portion of the course features analysis of the international negotiations over arms control and non-proliferation that have featured since the late 1960s and the controversies they generated. Throughout the course students will engage with contemporary writings and study primary source documents which will accompany each topic.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Students on the course will have as their objectives:\\n1.

People are interested in nature, the aesthetic, and the technological application of light. Light provides us with an omnipotent tool to perceive almost everything from the world of sub-atomic particles to the Cosmos, but a sustainable and effective solution for various sectors of modern life, including, but not limited to, food, communication, entertainment, energy, environment, and medicine. Microwave for food heating, fiber-optic telecommunication for the Internet, laser for the massive digital data storage and reading, light detection and ranging for the autonomous vehicle, x-ray for medical imaging, fluorescence for food quality assessment, etc., are among countless examples of the light-based technologies. Those have been integrated seamlessly into our daily life, but we rarely appreciate how they work. The course aims to provide a solid background of the fundamental characteristics of light, its interaction with the matter, the mechanism of the light production, light transportation, and light detection. We will discuss technological applications of those aspects in light of the well-established and emerging technologies. We hope by the end, students will treasure the beauty of light and explore it as a sustainable solution for our common home, the Earth. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\n\u2022 Some includes, but not limited to,  \\n\u2022 Understand the nature of light\\n\u2022 Understand how light is produced, how they interact with matter, how we can manipulate them \\n\u2022 Recognize the technical application of the light in the daily assets such as microwave, camera, x-ray\u2026\\n\u2022 Practical skills to handle the light source and light sensor\\n\u2022 Computing and data anlysis skills\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nTentative syllabus: for 6 hours/week in 8 weeks.

What is the future then?\\nIn this course, we will learn about important materials, their history, production, and properties. What makes paper, cloth, and plastic so different even though they are all organic polymers? What is the magic key step in both steel and semiconductor production? What properties make copper a great material for electronics and statues? Each material has its story full of ups and downs that involves not only science but also culture and economics. Their distinctive properties influence their usage in manufacturing and arts. How might these stories connect to you? What would be a perfect material in your opinion? We will explore questions like these, do some experiments, and have you look at the materials that make up your own living environment. We will also talk about pigments, which is a bit nontraditional for a material course, but I love them.

Instrumental analysis is crucial in conducting scientific research, evaluating the quality of materials including food and drinks, assessing environmental pollution and assisting forensic investigation, to name a few. In this courses, students will learn the science and conduct small projects using common instrumental techniques. They include Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Inverted Microscope (IM), Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and potentially others. FTIR is used to analyze chemical compositions and chemical bonds of a sample. IM with camera magnifies physical, chemical and biological processes happening in micrometer scale to observe and capture. RT-PCR monitors the amplification reaction of a targeted DNA molecule which can be used in numerous applications, such as quantifying microbial and vial load in a sample for the diagnostic of infectious diseases. ICP-OES is used to qualify and quantify chemical elements of a sample, especially metals. FTIR, IM and RT-PCR are available at Fulbright\'s lab. ICP-OES and other techniques are available at our collaborated labs and company.\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, students will:\\n\u2022 Demonstrate understanding of fundamental knowledge behind five instrumental analysis techniques: FTIR, Inverted Microscope, RT-PCR, ICP-OES and potentially others\\n\u2022 Demonstrate practical skills about using the above instruments\\n\u2022 Utilize software to visualize, analyze and calculate physical and chemical properties of molecules and materials using the above techniques\\n\u2022 Analyze data and present experimental data\\n\u2022 Writing scientific lab reports\\n---\\nCourse Schedule\\nTextbooks:\\nFundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering: An Integrated Approach, 5th Editionby William D.

We will read in order to understand texts as cultural artifacts specific to the time and place of their composition, and in order to investigate the sociopolitical implications of literary texts, both for their time and ours. We will read to foster critical thinking skills and to become better examiners of texts. We will read for aesthetic appreciation. We will read for the sheer thrill of it.

K. Rowling, Ralph Ellison, Italo Calvino, and Viet Thanh Nguyen. Our texts will be Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone, Invisible Man, Invisible Cities, and The Sympathizer. We will examine theories of identity and otherness, and discover the origin of the Invisibility Cloak. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: \\nWe will read the entirety of Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s The Committed, his 2021 sequel to the Pulitzer Prize winning book The Sympathizer. (It is not necessary to have read the first book, since the plot is helpfully recapitulated in the opening section.) The Committed is a searing indictment of colonialism, and presents a nameless narrator who is split into three separate selves. We will also read the beginning third of Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man, the 1952 masterpiece on which The Committed is very loosely based. Like Nguyen, Ellison introduces a nameless narrator whose internal conflicts threaten to tear him apart. We will read most of J. K. Rowling\u2019s brilliant treatment of the subject of otherness and belonging, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone (originally published in 1997 as Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone), which painfully exposes the divide between wizards and humans. Additional texts introducing other theoretical angles on the question of invisibility will be brought in as necessary. Students will be evaluated on four things: 1) class participation throughout the course, 2) a short presentation, 3) five written responses keyed to the readings, and 4) two written papers, the first analyzing a small shared aspect of the texts, and the second providing an opportunity for a broader perspective on what is a wide-ranging subject of inexhaustible interest to human beings.\\n---\\nCourse Schedule\\nTexts:\\nJ.

Young people have been the backbone of post-colonial struggles, nation-building process, and various social and cultural movements across the region. Although there has been a growing interest in youth\u2019s relationship with broader social issues, Asian youth has received little attention in the classroom. This course aims to offer students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of youth and society in Asia and to explore youth\u2019s significance in the region\u2019s past, present, and future. It begins from examining various theoretical traditions that conceptualize and treat youth in different manners. It then examines critical historical periods in which youth played a critical part in instigating or otherwise shaping major processes of political and social change in Asia. Finally, the course investigates and compares various relationships that Asian youth have developed with the state, citizenship and culture from a perspective that sheds light on the interplay of individual developments and broader sociocultural contexts. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning youth in Vietnam and Asia.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\n\u2022 Comprehend social and cultural developments in relation to youth\u2019s place and role in Vietnam and Asia;\\n\u2022 Use basic concepts and theories of youth from social and cultural sciences;\\n\u2022 Read critically the literature and other materials;\\n\u2022 Write and present academic research reports; and\\n\u2022 Reflect upon youth\u2019s relationships with the state and society in Vietnam and Asia.\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nWeek 1: Introduction - Film discussion\\nWeek 2: Youth: concepts and theories\\nWeek 3: Youth in Asia\u2019s modern history\\nWeek 4: Youth in contemporary Asia: Northeast Asia\\nWeek 5: Youth in contemporary Asia: Southeast Asia\\nWeek 6: Youth and the state - Youth as citizens\\nWeek 7: Midterm quiz/exam - Film discussion\\nWeek 8: Youth and economic development - Youth and work\\nWeek 9: Youth and political participation - Youth and political representation\\nWeek 10: Youth and identity - Youth and gender\\nWeek 11: Research project presentations and peer-reviews\\nWeek 12: Youth and culture - Field research (Group)\\nWeek 13: Youth and digital world - Field research (Individual)\\nWeek 14: Research findings presentations and peer-reviews\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nClass participation -- 20%\\nMidterm quiz/exam -- 20%\\nResearch Project Presentation -- 10%\\nResearch findings presentations -- 20% \\nFinal essay -- 30%","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"}],"location":"Action"},{"title":"Augustus in Saigon?

Particularly, the colonial past has been written into the urban space (in form of architectures, monuments, inscriptions, etc.) in a penetrating way. With it, Greek and Roman antiquities have entered and framed the peoples\u2018 and viewers\u2018 mind, too, either directly or indirectly. \\nThe aim of the course is to open these framed and framing spaces for a critical dialogue about the use, and abuse, of classical themes in the past and the way we can deal with this heritage in the present, and future. This dialogue will be triggered and established by linking classicized spaces in present-day Ho Chi Minh City with original artifacts of Graeco-Roman antiquity in a digital, interactive way. \\nBuilding on the concept of smart city, we will activate the students to critically deal with, and reflect on, the classical heritage by creating a digital exhibition via OMEKA that links the physically present structures with digital objects in a communicative, interactive way. This digital exhibition also enables the broader public to engage with their own past and to give them a handy tool at hand to live their urban space anew in the 21st century.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\n\u2022 introduction to theories and methodologies in history/art history/architecture (e.g., critical source analysis; discourse theory; structuralist- and post-structuralist approaches; frame and framing theories; image theory; social space theory; affordances; actor-object-networks; object-biography) [scientific competences]\\n\u2022 introduction to digital tool OMEKA (basic html-programming skills; cross-linking; design of digital maps, timelines, audio-video-files etc.) [digital humanities comp.]\\n\u2022 analysis of selected urban spaces and Graeco-Roman artifacts with respective research literature [scientific comp.]\\n\u2022 interpretation of innate narratives of the selected sources in critical manner [transfer and critical engagement comp.]\\n\u2022 creation of digital exhibition (by application of skills aquired from steps before) [digital humanities comp.]\\n\u2022 organisation and management of complex group-work (assignment of tasks and responsibilities; feedback culture; presentation skills etc.) [social and organizational comp.]\\n\u2022 audience-oriented presentation and marketing of digital exhibition (writing of appealing texts; balanced text-image-relation; logo / corporate identity design; etc.) [organizational and transfer comp., media comp.]\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nTopic/Content: Introduction to the topic \\nForm: Team-building activity / first orientation & examples\\nTopic/Content: Introduction to Historical Source Criticism\\nForm: Reflection on historical analysis and interpretation I\\nReading: J.

At the end of the nineteenth century, the \u201cnew woman\u201d pushed against the limits imposed by society. Following the footsteps of their counterparts in Europe and North America, the East Asian \u201cnew woman\u201d emerged during the interwar period seeking autonomy, redefining the feminine, exploring new ideas, lifestyles and behavior, and negotiating between the \u201ctraditional\u201d and the \u201cmodern\u201d. More than a century has passed but women of the 21stcentury still find themselves facing the challenges of negotiating between dominant gender roles and desires for self-liberation and self-determination. The course focuses on the dilemmas that women had to and still have to deal with in their pursuit of liberation and in their fight against suppression. In doing so, it specifically considers various structural, cultural, and technological factors that have shaped and transformed new womanhood of the early modern period and the 21stcentury. Throughout the semester, students will consider how social structures and cultural practices have affected women and also how women themselves have struggled for equal status and rights. Among others, the course explores various ways, resources, and outcomes of women\u2019s constant negotiations between the dominant gender ideologies and desires for self-liberation and self-determination. Students will examine a variety of texts with the aim of investigating the continuity and change in narrations on new womanhood in general and in Asia in particular.\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\nComprehend the historical context in which the \u201cnew woman\u201d emerge during the early modern period;\\nRelate women\u2019s variegated experiences of emerging as the \u201cnew woman\u201d in the public sphere to specific national, regional and global contexts;\\nUnderstand women\u2019s dilemmas in their pursuit of liberation and in their fight against suppression in the early modern and 21st-century context;\\nDevelop analytical skills in examining women\u2019s constant negotiations between the dominant gender ideologies and desires for self-liberation and self-determination; and,\\nWrite and present academic research reports.\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nWeek 1: Introduction\\nFilm discussion: \u201cTokyo Story\u201d by Ozu Yasujiro (1953)or \u201cSweet Dream\u201d by Ju-nam Yang (1936)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmd_OBPFll8\\nWeek 2: Women, education, and modern technology\\nWeek 3: Women, consumption, and agency\\nWeek 4: Women and modernity in early modern period\\nWeek 5: \u201cNew women\u201d vs. \u201cmodern girls\u201d\\nWeek 6: Colonialism, nationalism, and the \u201cwise mother, good wife\u201d ideology\\nWeek 7: Midterm exam\\nFilm discussion: \u201cYeongja\u2019s Heyday\u201d by Ho Sun Kim (1975) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlPoTeWINSg\\nWeek 8: Women, development, and the state\\nWeek 9: Women, work, and power\\nWeek 10: Women, feminism, and the \u201c#MeToo\u201d movement\\nWeek 11: \u201cTiger mother\u201d vs. \u201cparasite single\u201d(parasaito shinguru) and\u201cKimchi woman\u201d (kimchinyeo)\\nWeek 12: Panel discussion 1: \u201cnew women\u201d vs. \u201cmodern girls\u201d\\nPanel discussion2: love, marriage, and new womanhood\\nWeek 13: Panel discussion3: women and the state\\nPanel discussion 4: women, feminism, and nationalism\\nWeek 14: Group project presentations\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nClass participation (20%)\\nMidterm exam (20%)\\nGroup Project (30%)\\nFinal essay (30%)","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Action"},{"title":"Language, Culture and Thought","id":"SOCI305_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Ian Scott Kalman","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OhQAJ/soci305spring2022s01","description":"Faculty: Ian Scott Kalman \u2013 E: ian.kalman@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCourse Format: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: What is language - and could we even ask this question without it? Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Language is not just about communication, words such as \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  \\nLanguage is intimately tied to experience \u2013 the way we talk about an event has a bearing on how we understand that event \u2013 were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d, or an insult? As much as language is something that humans produce, language is also part of what makes us human.  \\nThis course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in the study of language, beginning with philosophical questions on the origins of human language, the creation of linguistics as a distinct field of research, and the terms by which scholars have considered the relationships between language and culture.  \\nCore concepts include linguistic relativity, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. Core themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.  \\nPlease note, this is not a linguistics course. We will not be learning new languages or emphasizing the technical components of syntax and use. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as many core texts will be in English and draw upon English\\nLearning Objectives: Students Will Be Able To (SWBAT): \\n\u2022 Understand the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology as it commonly appears in academic texts.\\n\u2022 Identify the role of language in their own culture and thought with increasing amounts of subtlety and depth.  \\n\u2022 Employ key concepts from sociolinguistics in oral discussions and both a written paper and exam.  \\n\u2022 Develop and execute a research project relating to language, culture, and thought in their own lives.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nClass Participation -- 20%\\nThird-Term Exam -- 20%\\nArticle Review -- 10%\\nFinal Project Presentation -- 20%\\nFinal Project Paper -- 30%","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Science Lab"},{"title":"Global Political Economy","id":"SOCI307_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Jonathan London","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OUQAZ/soci307spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Jonathan London - E: jonathan.london@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: Foundations of Political Economy and/or Principles of Economics\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCourse Format: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course introduces theoretical and methodological approaches to the analysis of the world economy from the vantage point of global political economy (GPE), a multi-disciplinary field of inquiry that is founded on the assumption that economic aspects of social life may not be understood independently of politics and the broader sets of social relations and world historical contexts within which economics processes unfold.

We will investigate the central themes, theories, concepts, and questions of the contemporary study of comparative politics and explore the main theoretical, empirical, and methodological approaches to the study of Vietnamese politics. Why do nation states vary so substantially in their political freedoms and economic performances? What are similarities and differences that Vietnam bears from a comparative perspective? This course will seek to answer these big questions by developing an understanding of key concepts, theories and political system and policies of Vietnam. The course intertwines two major parts with Part I forming the foundation of the course by introducing the history, concepts, theories, and methodologies of Comparative Politics and the other exploring the actors and processes involved in the detailed case study, Vietnam. The course has a strong discussion-centered structure. Students are expected to read the assigned materials timely and thoughtfully and be ready to discuss the content in class.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Students should be able:\\nTo demonstrate a basic understanding of the relationships between individuals, actors, and processes across different political systems both historical and contemporary.\\nTo facilitate and/or cultivate a sense of critical awareness of the world beyond their own.\\nTo develop a stronger understanding of fundamental differences between different regime types, the relationship between politics and economic outcomes, the role of identity in politics.\\nTo apply the analytical and methodological tools of comparative politics to political outcomes they want to understand and explain.\\nTo use these tools to further examine the political system and policies of Vietnam. \\n---\\nCourse Readings:\\nThere is no textbook for this course.

Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts. Nowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular.   \\nBased on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past. This course help Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives.\\nIn addition, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese helps to re-establish a cultural and historical connection with East Asia, not only with China and Taiwan, but also Japan and the Korean nations. It is worth noting that these days, the Japanese still use 2,136 common Kanji (or Chinese characters with Japanese pronunciations). Those words can all be found in Vietnamese literary Chinese introduced in this course. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems. Students are also guided to use the dictionaries in different ways to be able to look up the vocabulary themselves.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: There are 3 basic Learning Objectives of this course:\\nHelping students understand Vietnamese cultural heritage better through Vietnamese literary Chinese texts.\\nHelping students to learn Sino-Vietnamese pronunciations of Chinese characters along with standard modern Chinese dictions, and to use Sino-Vietnamese words more accurately and effectively in modern Vietnamese language.\\nHelping students have a broader view of the culture and history of East Asian Cultural Sphere / Kanji Cultural Sphere.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance: 15%\\nQuizzes: 20%\\nMid-term: 15%\\nFinal exam: 50%","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Meeting room 1"},{"title":"Documentary Films from Vietnam: History, Theory, and Practice","id":"VS108_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Dao Le Na","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OaQAJ/vs108spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Dao Le Na - E: na.dao@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: Not recommended for students who have not completed Core requirement.\\nCourse Format: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: Documentary film has always had a certain appeal to the audience because it manifests the filmmakers\u2019 observation and point of view on real life. \u2018Reality\u2019, as Patricia Aufderheide mentioned in his book Documentary Film: a Very Short Introduction \u201cis not what is out there but what we know, understand, and share with each other of what is out there (\u2026) Documentary is an important reality-shaping communication, because of its claims to truth. Documentaries are always grounded in real life, and make a claim to tell us something worth knowing about it.\u201d Therefore, social issues of national identity, collective memory, gender, the diaspora will be effectively communicated to the audience through the visual expression of documentary storytelling.\\nThis course is directed to students who like watching documentaries and hope to make documentaries. The teaching team including Vietnamese documentary researchers and filmmakers will help students to focus on analyzing selected documentaries and practical filmmaking training. Students of this course will learn how to write a screenplay including find an idea and develop their ideas by multiple methods such as observation, field- notes, oral history, and narrative structure. Documentary filmmaking techniques will be trained by filmmakers through camera using, sound recording, log writing, and film editing. One of the course\u2019s features is that its students will make a documentary film based on Vietnamese cultural and social materials exposed to them during the course. At the end of the course, students will submit a documentary film in which academic knowledge can be utilized and integrated.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: This course will aim to:\\n\u2022 The ability to evaluate a documentary film\\n\u2022 Understanding the values of national documentary film and the relation between cinema and national identities.\\n\u2022 Understanding how to explore and handle cultural and social materials in making a documentary film\\n\u2022 Finding suitable storytelling tools and aesthetic viewpoints for a filmmaker\u2019s discourse\\n\u2022 Finding a suitable style to produce their films.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to:\\n\u2022 Be able to analyze a documentary film and write critically about how the film presents its aesthetic form and communicates its meaning\\n\u2022 Understanding the history of documentary film and identifying conventions and elements of a documentary film\\n\u2022 Understanding current debates about documentary ethics and aesthetics.\\n\u2022 Prepare and submit their own documentary film in appropriate storytelling\\n---\\nCourse schedule\\nRequired Materials\\nBernard, Sheila Curran (2004) Documentary Storytelling for Video and Filmmakers.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems.

The course will be focused on the connection between different levels of intervention for the green planning and design, including village/district and relative technologies involved, especially the low and middle-tech, chosen according to the local conditions, culture and economy, what it is called Multi-Scale Approach. The discussion will touch several scales of design, from the bioregional scale down to the building. A common mistake in the discussion concerning the sustainability is the fragmentation of the planning. A single green building can not reach any results if it is not conceived into a large scale perspective. For this reason, the theory proposed in the course is the sustainability in a large scenario but connected with the local scale. Bio-Region, sustainable transportation system, Eco-Village and Eco-District, and finally Eco-Building will be connected with an organic plan, generating a general strategy where macro- and micro-scales are coherent and connected.\\nAn important part of the research will be the issue of the sustainable transportation. This mostly concerns the different modality of transportation, their structure and inter-connection, TOD system and Smart Node.\\nThe theory concerning the sustainability, Eco-Village and Eco-District will be both technical and theoretical. This teaching is based on a series of books that Professor Paolo Vincenzo Genovese published in the past years. Professor Genovese will apply his experience as a professional designer in sustainable district and Eco-Village planned in the Chinese context.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nTo analyze the complexity of the sustainability at large scale;\\nTo consider the sustainability as a complex system made by various variables.

In view of the urgent problems of our time, for example, climate change, it is entrepreneurs who inspire hope with technology-based developments and thus play a central role in politics and society. At the same time, entrepreneurs are ambivalent contemporaries who are seen as role models and are envied because of their success but are also often confronted with criticism and suspicion. All over the world, entrepreneurship is increasingly popular and is being promoted by governments, international organizations, and local NGOs as an income-generating strategy or as a solution to so-called \\"disaster capitalism\\".\\nIn this course, we approach the anthropology of entrepreneurship from different theoretical perspectives. Starting in the middle of the 20th century, where on the one hand the relationship between entrepreneurship and social change (or the entrepreneur as a change agent) and the role of entrepreneurship in economic development were in focus, we follow how the perception and the view of anthropologists changed over time. Ethnographic examples range from Melanesian big men who became entrepreneurs, to ethnic, religious, ecological, and social entrepreneurship and to research on individual self-realization through entrepreneurship.\\n---\\nCourse Objectives \\nLearning objectives event\\nGetting to know theoretical debates and empirical case studies on entrepreneurship\\nIndependent literature research\\nStudents learn to critically question concepts relevant to the course\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes \\nAfter completing this course, students will be able to: \\nAcquire an understanding of the historical, political, and cultural context, current trends and future projections of digital technologies; \\nExplain basic concepts and theories in new (digital) media; \\nUnderstand the critical impact of media on a variety of contemporary issues such as privacy, surveillance, labor, and participation, as well as the construction of individual identity \u2013 gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality. \\nBe able to critically examine and utilize digital tools in meaningful and innovative ways. \\n---\\nAssessments\\nClass Participation\\nPresentation\\nSeminar Paper\\nLife Story Interviews (transcribed)","categories":[],"schedule":[]},{"title":"Evolution of Vietnamese Society in the 20th century from a multidisciplinary per","id":"VS301_Summer2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Hoang Thach Quan","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002QXPXgQAP/vs301summer2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Hoang Thach Quan \u2013 E: quan.hoang@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCross-listed: Vietnam Studies, Social Studies\\nFormat: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\n\u201cConnections are the source of life in Vietnam\u2026 [They] are constitutive of [the Vietnamese] self, community, and nation,\u201d observes a Vietnam scholar. This course examines those vital connections and the social structures that create, shape and sustain them. In doing so, we will examine how those structures have been transformed and changed throughout the twentieth century up to the present moment. In this interdisciplinary course, we will draw on a variety of historical, sociological and anthropological works to help shed light on the ways \u201csocial capital,\u201d to use a modern concept, is built (or destroyed) and human connections preserved (or severed) for countless generations of Vietnamese, past and present.  \\nAlthough the focus of the course is contemporary Vietnamese society and culture, any exploration of the present would be woefully incomplete without it being firmly anchored in the past, which for our course revolves around the traditional village and community that has been the life blood of Vietnam for the past thousands of years. We will therefore begin our course by looking at the traditional Vietnamese village structures and the social norms that govern the life choices and behavior of its residents. From there we embark on a historical journey that takes us through the colonial, revolutionary, and post-revolutionary periods until we reach the present time. \\nThroughout the course students are encouraged to think about the structural forces that deeply influence, or in most cases, dictate one\u2019s thoughts and behaviors, and the role and place of an individual in the larger social structure in which he/she is embedded. Questions that students taking this course may want to think about include, but are not limited to, the following: What are the sources of Vietnamese culture and identity? How important are human connections and how can they be preserved? Is one\u2019s identity permanent and fixed, or is it contingent, fluid and negotiable? Would a Vietnamese person today still recognize and understand a Vietnamese born hundreds of years ago? Is it possible to essentialize some quality (or set of qualities) that captures all that is Vietnamese?  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe course aims to give students a better understanding of Vietnamese society and culture and the trajectory of her evolution for the last one hundred years or so from a multidisciplinary perspective.  \\nStudents will be introduced to basic concepts in the humanities, sociology and anthropology. This will provide them with a wider and sharper lens through which to view themselves, their society, and hopefully also the wider world into which Vietnam is trying integrate\\nStudents will be able to interpret and analyze the causes and consequences of many common social, cultural phenomenon in modern-day Vietnam. On that basis, it is hoped that they will accordingly formulate an appropriate philosophical outlook and chart an effective and wise career path for personal development and social betterment after graduation.\\n---\\nCourse Schedule\\nSESSION 1 Introducing Key Concepts and Theoretical Framework to Understand the Trajectory of Vietnamese Society\u2019s Evolution \\nReading \\nT\xf6nnies, Ferdinand. \u201cCommunity and Society [Gemeinschaft Und Gesellschaft]\u201d in Jan Lin & Christopher Mele, eds.
