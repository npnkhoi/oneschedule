Artificial intelligence (AI) is a research field that studies how to realize the intelligent human behaviors on a computer. The ultimate goal of AI is to make a computer that can learn, plan, and solve problems autonomously. In this course, student will learn the foundational principles and practice implementing some of these applications including representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence. Accordingly, students should be able to develop intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems; understand the role of knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning in intelligent-system engineering; and appreciate the role of problem solving, vision, and language in understanding human intelligence from a computational perspective.\n ---\nLearning Objectives\nThe main purpose of this course is to provide the most fundamental knowledge to the students so that they can understand what the AI is. Students who become interested in AI may go on to the graduate school for further study. Upon the successful completion of this course students will be able to:\nAbility to apply knowledge of AI techniques and synthesize solutions to the discipline and ability to develop a range of typical applications using artificial intelligence methods.\nAbility to represent knowledge corresponding to practical problems, design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs by properly using classical search algorithms, including breadth-first, depth-first, A*, and heuristic search.\nAbility to produce intelligent applications of machine learning with statistical learning methods (Na\u00efve Bayes), supervised and unsupervised learning models: decision tree, neural networks, single-layer (perceptron) and multilayer networks\n---\nTextbook and References\nArtificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents by Poole and Mackworth.

We first discuss the history of ideas in anthropological theory surrounding ideas of power and social change: early functionalist approaches presumed static traditions, whereas Marxist, feminist and postcolonial intellectual movements invited anthropologists to theorize structure and agency, power and contradiction, dialectics and change. Common-sense notions of \u201csocial movement\u201d still pose a conceptual challenge to anthropology and ethnography as a method: What distinguishes a social movement from social change broadly put? An anthropological approach to politics means that the modern western delimitation of the \u201cpolitical\u201d must itself be viewed as a historical development, and one with gendered, classed and racialized dimensions. How do we locate a social movement ethnographically? What does ethnography as method teach us about social movements that we might not otherwise see? How do we proceed ethically, attending to questions of positionality, subjectivity, objectivity?  \nThese conceptual discussions are presented in relation to ethnographic studies in Latin America, East Asia, North America and Eastern Europe, wherein students are also introduced to general disciplinary debates such as the challenges of multisited ethnography, cultural relativism, conceptualizing relations between the \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cglobal\u201d, digital ethnography, fieldwork methods and ethics, and practices of public anthropology, including writing to and for participants in social movements. The case studies are explored to emphasize the particular benefit of approaching \u201csocial movements\u201d with an anthropological lens onto everyday life; in the process, social theoretical concepts such as Marxism, anarchism, feminism and intersectionality are themselves productively decentered as cultural and historical objects.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\nFrame research and questions within the context of the field\u2019s historic foundations  \nApply and explain texts and concepts in social science theory. \nAnalyze social science theory related to 'social movements' as a history of ideas\nUnderstand the disciplinary methodology of ethnography in relation to the topic.\n---\nTentative Syllabus\nJune 14\nIntroduction to Class\nMODULE I : Social Movements in Theory\nJune 21\nPART I: Social Movements in Anthropological Perspective: What is Politics?  \nNelson, Lise. 2003. \"Decentering the Movement: Collective Action, Place, and the 'Sedimentation' of Radical Political Discourses.\" Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 21:559-581.\nLagalisse, Erica. 2013. \"Gossip as Direct Action.\" In Contesting Publics: Feminism, Activism, Ethnography, edited by Sally and Lynne Phillips Cole.

Using examples drawn from various points in history, various countries around the world, and various disability categories (psychiatric/psychosocial, intellectual, physical, etc.), students read a variety of texts, including ethnographies, autobiographies, and case studies, in order to understand the variety of the disability experience. This class draws from critical disability studies, feminist, and queer theory. \n---\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of this course students should be able to:\nExplain the difference between the medical model and social model of disability and how these two models work in practice\nDiscuss the social, legal, and personal effects of each model on how different cultures (including the U.S.) treat persons with disabilities\nIdentify and explicate key themes in the study of disability from a socio-cultural perspective\nCritically discuss bioethical debates around disability\nIdentify and discuss how disability is experienced differently from an intersectional (class, race, gender, sex, ethnicity, nationality) viewpoint\n---\nTentative Syllabus\nWeek 1.0 Introduction to the Course; Smashing Stereotypes; Disability Theory\nAdichie, Chimamanda Ngozi. 2009. \u201cThe Danger of a Single Story\u201d TED Talk. https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story\nHand out syllabus\nCourse requirements and expectations\nQ&A\nHayes, Michael T. and Rhonda S.
