        "description": "Visiting Faculty: Jacqueline Hoang-Nguyen\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\nPre-requisite: No\n* This course serves as a prerequisite for most intermediate and advanced Art and Media Studies courses.\n---\nCourse Description:\nImages function as both a practical artistic medium (in advertisements for example) but also as something to be aesthetically enjoyed. They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\n---\nSample Topic Schedule\n\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\n1. The Power of Images: Why study the visual?\n2. Signification and Value\n3. Vision/Perspective/Realism\n4. Technologies of Vision and Reproduction\n5.

        "description": "Visiting Faculty: Arlette Quynh-Anh Tran\nPre-requisite: ART101 Introduction to Visual Studies AND at least two 200-level courses in ARTS\n---\nCourse Description:\nTraditionally understood as the practice of selecting and caring for objects to be shown in a museum, or to form part of a collection of art or an exhibition, curating has now gained broader definition and currency within the cultural and creative industries. Beyond the popular understanding of curating as exhibition-making, this course will focus on what it means to curate as a critical and creative practice, and how curators conceive of stories and concepts within specific contexts. By reading texts, surveying key exhibitions, meeting guest speakers, visiting art spaces, and doing hands-on assignments and practical training, students will explore the traditional, artistic, and multidisciplinary possibilities of curating.\nWe will learn about the influences, controversies, and thresholds of curatorship within different contexts, both historical and geographical, aesthetic and political. Saigon will serve as a local context of curating practice, as demonstrated through notable exhibitions from the modern postcolonial nation-building period of the late 1950s, and the post-Doi Moi period of the early 2000s to present.\nThrough such case studies, we will analyze how exhibitions intersect with political representation and aesthetic developments, and investigate in more depth how one can curate between different contexts, such as from the urban to the rural; from the national to the regional to the international; and from a historical perspective to that of the future.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to:\n1. Explain the concept of an art ecology\n2. Demonstrate familiarity with current discourses of art, production, and exhibition-making in Saigon, Vietnam, and related regional and international contexts\n3. Develop the research and practical skills needed for a diverse curatorial project\n4. Clearly communicate curatorial concepts and theories in written and spoken form\n5. Navigate the forms of collaboration and phases of production that the curatorial process entails\n---\nTentative Schedule\nWeek 1: Exhibition Histories I: Curation and Contemporaneity\nWeek 2: Exhibition Histories II: Curation and Politics\nWeek 3: Exhibition Histories III: Curation and Community\nWeek 4: Curation and the City\nWeek 5: Curating the non-physical and the interdisciplinary\nWeek 6: Curation and Narrative\nWeek 7: ART SPACE VISITS\nWeek 8: Curatorial project Pitching Presentation I\nWeek 9: Curatorial project Pitching Presentation II\nWeek 10: Collaboration in Curatorship\nWeek 11: How to work with artists? // ARTIST STUDIO VISITS\nWeek 12: Production management, Conservation, and Object Handling\nWeek 13: Final project presentation I\nWeek 14: Final project presentation II\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nReading Response Presentation: 25%\nHomework: 25%\nCuratorial Proposal Presentation: 20%\nFinal Project: 30%",

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future. Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: After completing the course, students will be able to\n1. Understand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\n2. Define the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\n3. Decompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\n4. Build a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\n5. Improve communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nMaker Space Training: 20%\nTheory: 40%\nApplication: 40%",

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future. Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: After completing the course, students will be able to\n1. Understand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\n2. Define the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\n3. Decompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\n4. Build a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\n5. Improve communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nMaker Space Training: 20%\nTheory: 40%\nApplication: 40%",

This introductory course is divided into two parts. The first part of this course focuses on philanthropic giving while the second part focuses on philanthropic effectiveness. Key questions to be examined in part one include why and how people give (time, money, skills, etc.). Key questions to be examined in part two include why and how to evaluate philanthropic effectiveness. In addition, students will be invited to consider how government policy influences giving and effectiveness. As students explore these questions, they will draw upon academic scholarship from multiple disciplines ranging from psychology and economics to ethics and philosophy. \n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nMajor learning outcomes:\nApply economic analysis to everyday problems, evaluate policies and the data supporting them, investigate arguments, and analyze the world in terms of trade-offs and incentives. \nCollect, interpret, and manipulate quantitative data to address real-world problems. \nDisplay a command of existing knowledge by explaining key economic theories and concepts and describing how they can be used. \nWork in and lead teams; ensure students can navigate diverse audiences and environments. \nCreate new knowledge by identifying and formulating a question on some economic issue that will facilitate its investigation. \nPrepare for masters or doctoral programs in Economics or related disciplines such as Public Policy and Data Science at top-tier international program\nCourse learning outcomes:\nBy the end of this course students will be able to: \nUnderstand the role of philanthropy in society\nExplain different reasons for giving. \nIdentify desirable philanthropic outcomes for different stakeholders. \nEvaluate and critique different methods used to measure social change. \nDesign a philanthropic strategy for an organization. \n---\nTentative Course Syllabus\n\nWeek \nTopic \nReadings \n1 \nWhat is philanthropy? \nSchein (2009) \u201cWhat is help?\u201d Chapter 1 in Helping: How to offer, give, and receive help, Understanding effective dynamics in one-to-one, group, and organizational relationships \n2 \nPerspectives on philanthropy \nGiridharadas, Anand.

        "description": "Faculty: Lan Nguyen\nReading/Writing: Intensive\nPre-requisite: All Core courses; ECON101 Principles of Economics 1; ECON201 Microeconomic Analysis\n---\nCourse Description: Educational policy is increasingly based on ideas, theories, and empirical research from economics. Accountability, school choice, charter schools, vouchers, privatization, merit pay for teachers, and school funding are just a few noteworthy examples. This course will explore how economists think about education in general as well as these specific policies and the underlying economic theories. We will address the following questions:\n* What concepts, theories, perspectives, methods, and insights do economists bring to education policy debates, in both K-12 and higher education?\n* How is economic thinking used to support and/or oppose specific educational policies? To what extent and in what ways does school choice \u201cincrease competition\u201d among schools? Is there a teacher shortage? If so, how might it be eliminated? How can schools attract high quality teachers? Do too many, or too few, students go on to college?\n* What are the most important research studies conducted by economists of education? What have these contributed to our understanding of education? The readings are mostly drawn from the extensive literature on the U.S. education system, but many issues are universally relevant, and students are encouraged to make connections to their own experience and the Vietnamese education system.\n---\nCourse learning outcomes (CLOs): By the end of the course, the students should be able to:\nCLO1: explain the key economic concepts and models relevant to education and describe their specific applications in educational issues\nCLO2: explain how economists approach educational issues and how the economic approach to education differs from that of sociologists and other education researchers.\nCLO3: understand the key policy issues in education and pose relevant questions whose answers help inform these issues\nCLO4: evaluate the effectiveness of different education policies and propose appropriate policies to address educational issues.\nCLO5: conduct independent research on educational issues.\nCLO6: collaborate and work in teams effectively\n---\nTentative Course Syllabus\nThere is no textbook for this course.

By definition, a signal is any observable change in quantity over space or time. It could help observers to obtain information about a phenomenon. In nature, signals can be actions done by organisms to alert other organisms or sounds or motions by animals to alert other animals of danger or food. Advances in technology have improved the capabilities of human beings to identify, analyze and even synthesize diverse information sources such as audio (speech, acoustics, music), image (photos, videos, multimedia, medical scans), medical signals (heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity) and remote sensing data (geophysical, sensing, radar). In principle, signals could be represented as data values or abstractly as mathematical expressions. A system converts or manipulate an input signal into an output signal. Examples of systems are face recognition, video streaming, cellular phones, and smart homes. In this course, students will learn to use mathematical theory and computer simulation to develop models, to analyze and to manipulate signals and systems that vary in continuous-time and discrete time. Specifically, the course covers representation of signals and systems, systems properties, conversion between continuous-time and discrete-time, Laplace, Fourier and z-transforms, transfer functions, frequency responses, convolution, stability, feedback and control systems. Students will gain hands-on experience on how to process various types of signals and to analyze and design systems by computer simulation using MATLAB or a similar software package.\n---\nCourse Learning Outcomes: After the course, students will be able to\n1. Demonstrate understanding of the key concepts and mathematical representation models of signals and systems.\n2.

Our goal is to develop a deep understanding of key historical \u2018moments\u2019, such as the Opium War and the Meiji Restoration, and the ability to situate those moments in the greater context of East Asian history. Lectures will be broad in scope while readings will be more narrowly focused. The course format will alternate between lecture and open-ended discussion.\nThe course is structured in four major units as follows:\nUnit 1: East Asian Order from 1600-1839\nUnit 2: Crisis and Adaptation (1839-1895)\nUnit 3: A New Balance of Power (1895-1945)\nUnit 4: Rebuilding after World War II (1945-present)\n---\nLearning Objectives: Students will develop knowledge, skills, and mindsets as follows:\nKnowledge: Students will develop a broad understanding of the contours of modern East Asian history and a deep understanding of certain events and figures.\nSkills: Students will learn to distinguish between primary and secondary sources as well as between scholarly and non-scholarly sources, and they will develop an ability to critically evaluate texts by referring to other sources and by drawing on the knowledge they acquire in this course.\nMindsets: Students will contemplate past ways of thinking about morality, politics, and religion in East Asia in order to make sense of the region's history. By extension, we will step outside of our usual ways of thinking about ethics, politics, and religion and develop a new appreciation for their historical contingency.\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nLecture Quizzes: 10%\nMapmaking assignment: 5%\nDiscussion participation: 10%\nUnit Reviews: 40%\nMid-term Exam: 15%\nFinal Exam: 20%",

During this timespan, the wars in Vietnam evolved from anti-colonial struggle to superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As the struggle for Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states, citizens\u2019 movements, and other non-state actors whose interpretations and responses to the war were conditioned by a variety of competing local agendas. This course will assess critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese, origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers commit so much to a small, distant country? What role did the larger Cold War play in shaping overseas powers\u2019 decision-making? What was impact of each party\u2019s respective domestic politics? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? How did it shape the politics and economy of the region? And what are the global legacies of the war?\nThe course will consider the Vietnam War as first and foremost a Vietnamese conflict, one which acquired increasingly global significance. In addition to exploring the domestic causes and dynamics of the Vietnam War, we will also consider the conflict - a seminal episode in the global Cold War - as a lens for analyzing a wide range of international events and trends. These include Empire and Decolonization; the Non-Aligned Movement; the Chinese Civil War; the American \u201cRed Scare\u201d; the Korean War; Development and Modernization Theory; the Sino-Soviet Split; China\u2019s Cultural Revolution; Detente; the rise of the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d; the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian Genocide; and the aftermaths, legacies, and interpretations of the conflict.\nThis course is a continuation of HIS208 The Global War Part I, taught during the Autumn semester. However it is open to any students; previous enrollment in HIS208 The Global War Part I is not required\n---\nLearning Outcomes: On completion of this module, students should be able to:\n\u2022 To identify the principal causes of the Vietnam War\n\u2022 To explore the factors prompting global powers to intervene, including the United States, France, the Soviet Union, South Korea, China, and Cambodia.\n\u2022 To assess the global impact of the Vietnam War\n\u2022 To engage with a range of theoretical and conceptual frameworks for understanding the war\n\u2022 To evaluate important methodological and historiographical trends relating to the conflict\n\u2022 Analyse a range of relevant primary and secondary sources.\n\u2022 Apply the skills acquired in formulating nuanced and sophisticated arguments supported by historical evidence\n\u2022 Apply transferable skills including effective written and oral communication, time management, and project management and completion, among others.\n\u2022 Demonstrate critical thinking and analytical skill, and the ability to articulate complex ideas and interpretations verbally and in writing.\n\u2022 Evaluate the interplay between domestic politics and foreign affairs in a wide range of global contexts.\n---\nTentative Schedule\nWeek One: Choosing War: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam\nReadings from: Lien-Hang Thi Nguyen, Pierre Asselin, Le Duan\n\nWeek Two: Choosing War: The United States\nReadings from David Kaiser, Fredrik Logevall, Robert Dallek, Francis Bator, John Newman\n\nWeek Three: Choosing War: The National Liberation Front\nReadings from David Elliott, David Hunt, Nguyen Thi Dinh, Truong Nhu Tang\n\nWeek Four: Modernisation and Development\nReadings from Michael Latham, Simon Toner, Walt Whitman Rostow\n\nWeek Five: Counterinsurgency\nReadings from Nguyen Cong Luan, Tran Ngoc Chau, Jonathan Schell, John Prados\n\nWeek Six: The Global Anti-War Movement\nReadings from Tom Wells, Adam Garfinkle, Heonik Kwon\n\nWeek Seven: Vietnamese Women at War\nReadings from: Sophie Quinn-Judge, Patricia Norland, An Nguyen\n\nWeek Eight: The Soviet Union\nReadings from Mari Olson, Sergey Radchenko\n\nWeek Nine: China\nReadings from Chen Jian, Qiang Zhai, Li Danhui, He Di\n\nWeek Ten: The Republic of Korea\nReadings from Heonik Kwon, Tak Tae Yang, Hwang Suk-Yong\n\nWeek Eleven: Southeast Asia\nReadings from Vincent Bevins, Richard Ruth, Thongchai Winichakul\n\nWeek Twelve: Vietnamisation\nReadings from Jeffrey Kimball, Larry Berman, Johannes Kadura\n\nWeek Thirteen: The Second Republic\nReadings from Sean Fear, Van Nguyen-Marshall, Hoang Duc Nha, Ly Quy Chung\n\nWeek Fourteen: Memories and Legacies\nReadings from Will Nguyen, Bui Tin, Bui Diem\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nEssay: 30%\nTake-home exam: 30%\nFormative writing exercise: 20%\nParticipation and attendance: 20%",

Why do we treat corporations as legal persons? Does capitalism need the state to function? Are corporations always a threat to states? What relationship does the development of the corporation have with the development of international law? Was the enclosure of the English commons the fundamental foundational act and original sin of capitalism, or simply one symptom among many? This course explores the consensuses and sharp disagreements among historians who have tried to answer these questions. Students will come to understand where they stand on these debates as well as conducting their own engagement with primary sources in English.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nStudents will understand the scholarly debates over how to define capitalism and pinpoint its historical origins, recognizing that different heuristics (e.g. Marxism, modern economic theories, intellectual history, legal history) will produce vastly different results.\nStudents will learn to produce high-quality primary source analysis in dialogue with the various schools of thought surveyed in the class.\nStudents will learn to synthesize primary source analyses into a longer research paper bringing together elements of historiography and primary source analysis.\nStudents will learn to identify how historical debates over the legal status of the corporation and the regulation of capitalism can be used to identify major problematics in contemporary economics and international law.\nStudents will learn to create effective presentations in conjunction with teammates and lead class discussions while effectively communicating their research\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nThree primary source analyses: 20%\nParticipation: 20%\nPresentation: 20%\nFinal paper: 40%",

Nonetheless, both the First Republic (1955-1963) and the Second Republic (1967-1975) had millions of supporters and were shaped by leaders and contributors who, whatever else, held sincere visions for what a constitutional, pluralistic Vietnam south of the Seventeenth Parallel might look like. This course provides a detailed assessment of the history of the Republic of Vietnam, beginning with its intellectual and political origins during the mid-colonial period through to its fraught manifestation and ultimate disintegration in the midst of a conflict that had evolved into a global Cold War struggle. In so doing we will examine the politics, economics, and culture of the Republic of Vietnam, addressing how and why the Republic came into being; the basis of Republican visions and ideology; and the nature and causes of the Republic\u2019s abrupt collapse from within in the fateful spring of 1975.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: On completion of this module, students should be able to:\n\u2022 To engage with a range of theoretical and conceptual frameworks for understanding the history of the Republic of Vietnam\n\u2022 To evaluate important methodological and historiographical trends relating to this time period.\n\u2022 Analyse a range of relevant primary and secondary sources.\n\u2022 Apply the skills acquired in formulating nuanced and sophisticated arguments supported by historical evidence.\n\u2022 Apply transferable skills including effective written and oral communication, time management, and project management and completion, among others.\n\u2022 Demonstrate critical thinking and analytical skill, and the ability to articulate complex ideas and interpretations verbally and in writing.\n---\nTentative Schedule\nWeek One: Ideological Origins of Republicanism\nReadings from Peter Zinoman, Christopher Goscha, Tuan Hoang, Agathe Larcher-Goscha\n\nWeek Two: The Colonial Bourgeoisie\nReadings from Martina Nguyen, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Patricia Norland, Anthony Morreale\n\nWeek Three: Urban and Rural Vietnam\nReadings from Hayden Cherry, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Gerard Sasges\n\nWeek Four: Print Media\nReadings from Philippe Peycam, Shawn McHale, Hue-Tam Ho Tai\n\nWeek Five: The First Republic: Origins\nReadings from Edward Miller, Jessica Chapman, Nguyen Phi-Van, Duy Lap Nguyen\n\nWeek Six: The First Republic: Development\nReadings Edward Miller, Philip Catton, Geoff Stewart\n\nWeek Seven: Constitutionalism\nReadings from Nu-Anh Tran, Edward Miller, Do Mau, Duong Thi Mai Elliott\n\nWeek Eight: Opposition and Protest\nReadings from Edward Miller, Vu Van Mau, Arthur Dommen\n\nWeek Nine: A Turbulent Interregnum\nReadings from Robert Topmiller, An Nguyen, Vo Long Trieu,\n\nWeek Ten: The Second Republic: Origins\nReadings from Sean Fear, Jay Veith, Charles Joiner, Allan Goodman\n\nWeek Eleven: The Second Republic: Power and Protest\nReadings from Sean Fear, An Nguyen, Nguyen Phi-Van, Tran Van Tuyen\n\nWeek Twelve: The Second Republic: Culture and Society\nReadings from Olga Dror, Ngo Vinh Long, Jason Gibbs, John Schafer\n\nWeek Thirteen: The Second Republic: Collapse from Within?\nReadings from Sean Fear, Dang Van Sung, Nguyen Be, Nha Ca\n\nWeek Fourteen: Aftermaths and Legacies\nReadings from Nguyen Thien Y, Bui Diem, Cao Xuan Huy, Sam Vong\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nFormative Writing Assignment 20%\nResearch Essay 30%\nOnline exam 30%\nAttendance and participation (including in-class exercises and presentations) 20%",

People are interested in nature, the aesthetic, and the technological application of light. Light provides us with an omnipotent tool to perceive almost everything from the world of sub-atomic particles to the Cosmos, but a sustainable and effective solution for various sectors of modern life, including, but not limited to, food, communication, entertainment, energy, environment, and medicine. Microwave for food heating, fiber-optic telecommunication for the Internet, laser for the massive digital data storage and reading, light detection and ranging for the autonomous vehicle, x-ray for medical imaging, fluorescence for food quality assessment, etc., are among countless examples of the light-based technologies. Those have been integrated seamlessly into our daily life, but we rarely appreciate how they work.

Through texts, both fiction and non-fiction, we chart the emergence of the \u2018modern\u2019 fashion system and learn how fashion mediates our understanding of a literary text. By the 1860s, fashion had become an integral part of daily urban life, an expression of modernity itself in the words of French poet Charles Baudelaire. Why did, for instance, canonical writers like Charles Baudelaire and Colette also happen to work as fashion journalists?\nIn what ways did the cultural mapping of fashion conducted by these writers from three distinct geographic areas diverge and converge? Why do so many modernist texts in the 20th century revolve around themes of dress? At once social, economic, political, and aesthetic in nature, fashion provides us with a unique lens through which to examine literature and culture. Key themes explored in the course include: rise of the modern city; gender and identity; class and capital; fashion and the environment. Some of the texts studied in the course include but are not limited to: \u201cSartor Resartus\u201d (Thomas Carlyle), \u201cPainter of Modern Life\u201d (Baudelaire), Ladies Paradise (Zola), Orlando (Virginia Woolf) and Banjo: A Story without a Plot (Claude McKay), among others.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: After successful completion of the course, students will be able to:\n1. Acquire an analytical and critical vocabulary in the study of literature, especially about narrative structure.\n2. Conduct close readings of literature with an awareness of the strategic use of clothing and accessories in narratives.\n3. Improve argumentative writing skills through weekly written assignments and papers.\n4. Extract abstract and complex ideas from texts and discuss them in class.\n5. Produce interdisciplinary connections by comparing historical, social, and artistic perspectives on the development of fashion across French, British, and American literary traditions.\n6. Practice using digital research platforms (image and text annotation, Gallica, StoryMaps, etc) that will culminate in a final project.\n---\nTentative Schedule:\nWeek 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Fashion and Narrative (critical tools)\nWeek 3: Fashion and Capitalism\nWeek 4: Fashion and Captialism (cont'd)\nWeek 5: Fashion and Capitalism (cont'd)\nWeek 6: Fashion, Gender, and Indentity\nWeek 7: Fashion, Gender, and Indentity\nWeek 8: Fashion, Gender, and Indentity\nWeek 9: Self-Fashioning: Fashion as Interculturality\nWeek 10: Self-Fashioning: Fashion as Interculturality\nWeek 11: Self-Fashioning: Fashion as Interculturality\nWeek 12: Self-Fashioning: the Dandy\nWeek 13: Fashion and Capitalism (post-modernity)\nWeek 14: Fashion and Capitalism (Post-modernity)\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nAttendance and participation: 30%\nTextual Analysis Presentation: 10%\nCreative Reflection on fashion: 5%\nMid-term paper: 25%\nFinal project: 30%",

Not without criticism, the show has been at the center of many debates surrounding the conversation about queerness, authenticity, and the commodification of queer identity. In an age where queerness, like the show, is as ubiquitous McDonald\u2019s corporatized branding of its various products for mass consumption, what radical politics does a category like queerness still hold, and to what extent is this reflected by global trends and the myriad of modernities? Indeed, for many activists, it might be said that RuPaul is as radical as McDonald\u2019s is gourmet. In this class, we will attempt to think through this question by analyzing a broad selection of cultural products across the globe ranging from film, music, to literature and social media that deals with queerness. Along the way, we will also cover current theories and discourses in order to provide a critical lens and tools for our inquiry.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: Students in the Literature major will: 1.

These include intimate relationships, sexuality, leadership, work, teams, environmental problems, popular culture, body image, digital gaming, social media, addiction and the conflict between traditional values and modern lifestyles. These topics will be explored in relation to our sense of self and identity, social interactions, intergroup relationships, how people develop knowledge of the world and the situated nature of human existence.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \n---\nLearning Objectives:\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \n---\nTentative Syllabus\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2VW_ACdTlNzySiySyfPfOrgxQztprrzGxxL_2pfo5Q/edit?usp=sharing \nSummary \nUnit One: Foundational Questions \u2013 This unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. The primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. Each week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d This unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \n Unit Two: The Human Experience \u2013 This unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. Each week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis. Different iterations of the class can select form a list of topics depending upon the instructor\u2019s preference. These topics include: Food, Sex, Death, Wealth, Nations, Power, Religion, Language, Law, Morality, Race. Readings include Margaret Wilson\u2019s Indulgence, Sidney Mintz\u2019s Sweetness and Power, Renato Rosaldo\u2019s Grief and the Headhunter\u2019s Rage, Marshall Sahlins\u2019 The Original Affluent Societies, Erik Harms\u2019s The Boss, Ernest Gellner\u2019s Nationalism, Benedict Anderson\u2019s Imagined Communities, Alice Goffman\u2019s \u2018On the Run\u2019.

And why should we care about it? Simply defined, ethics can be understood as a system of moral principles. As stated by Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics, \u201cWe are not concerned to know what goodness is but how to become good [people]\u2026, since otherwise our inquiry would be useless.\u201d This course introduces students to key texts and concepts in the study of ethics and moral philosophy. Students will connect theoretical approaches to the study of morality to one another, and to their own lives.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\n1. Demonstrate critical reading and thinking about dense philosophical texts through oral and written articulation of different philosophical ideas\n2. Demonstrate familiarity with classic texts and arguments related to ethics and moral philosophy through discussion and short- and long-form writing\n3. Demonstrate familiarity with the broader intellectual history and context of ethical and moral reasoning through discussion and short- and long-form writing\n4. Connect classical philosophical theories to contemporary local and global contexts through discussion and short- and long-form writing.\n---\nTentative Schedule:\nPart One - Classical Approaches: Epistemology We begin our class with an examination of philosophy in general.\nWe ask ourselves - what is philosophy for? What is wisdom? What does it do? How can we go from ignorance to knowledge?\nWeek One - Introductions, Apologies\nWeek Two - The Republic\n\nPart Two - Classical Approaches: Virtue Ethics in the East and West\nWe move to the first of the three most well known schools of moral philosophy - Virtue Ethics, which argues that virtuous action is necessary for the good life. We juxtapose the thoughts of two highly influential philosophers who lived around the same time in very different places, Aristotle and Confucius.\nWeek Three - Happiness and Virtue\nWeek Four - Friendship and Love\nWeek Five - Confucian Virtue Ethics\nWeek Six - Virtuous Junzi - Confucius and Aristotle in Vietnam\n\nPart Three - Nature and Culture - Social Contract and Natural Law Theory\nIn this section, we will discuss the significance of such concepts as \u201cnatural law\u201d, \u201crights\u201d, \u201clegitimacy\u201d, and \u201cliberty\u201d in the formulation of moral philosophy from the enlightenment onwards. After introducing the concept of natural law developed by Aquinas to reconcile contradictions between christian and aristotelian moral worldviews, we look at how the idea of \u201cnature\u201d has shaped philosophical thinking from Hobbes onwards.\nWeek Seven - Natural Law, Laws of Nature\nWeek Eight - Social Contract\n\nPart Four: Consequentialism and Deontology\nWeek Nine - Eleven\n\nPart Five: The Problem of Evil\nWeek Twelve - Fifteen\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nParticipation: 20%\nWritten Reflection: 60%\nFinal exam: 20%",

ARTS104 Video and Film Production; SOCI109 Ethnographic Research Methods; Two 200-level courses in either ARTS or SOCI or both.\n* Cross-listed with Arts and Media Studies (ARTS)\n---\nCourse Description:\nThis course explores the genre of ethnographic film\u2014its historical emergence, methodological innovations, and theoretical contribution to both anthropology and art. The course charts the evolution of ethnographic films from their initial concerns with representing the \u201cOther\u201d to their shifted attention to reflexivity and the politics of knowledge production across cultural boundaries. Throughout the course, we will be addressing various ethical, formal, and thematic concerns underlying contemporary thinking about ethnographic filmmaking. A variety of experimental ethnographic film and video makers will be introduced in weekly lectures and screenings. In the course of the semester, students will also be researching, assembling material, interviewing, and editing three short assignments and a final project that responds to the different thematical focuses. The formats utilized to produce these projects may include single-channel video, interactive video, or video installation. \n---\nLearning Outcomes:\nThis course aims to move beyond the fundamentals of ethnographic filmmaking toward the identification of this genre as an interdisciplinary art form, intricately intertwined with other disciplines of art and regimes of representation. As such, after successful completion of this course, students will be able to: \n1. Comprehend foundational terminologies and techniques in ethnographic filmmaking.\n2. Distinguish the major developments in the field of visual anthropology as related to the form of ethnographic film.\n3. Interpret and apply social inquiries to cinematic language.\n4. Describe and implement the elementary principles of ethnographic film production, including pre-production research (consent, interview guideline, and equipment preparation), production, and post-production.\n5. Produce a short ethnographic film in response to the materials introduced in class and the student\u2019s own interests\n---\nSyllabus\nMODULE 1: Realism\nWeek 1: Course overview\nPrinciple of production: Pre-production basics\nResearch, outline, release forms, interview preparation, equipment list.\nTerms: Ethnography, Allegory, Other, Primitivism\nFilm: \u201cThin Blue Line\u201d / Errol Morris\nReading: Margaret Mead, \u201cVisual anthropology in a discipline of words,\u201d in Principles of Visual Anthropology edited by Paul Hockings (Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton, 1995).\nLucien Castaing-Taylor, (1998) \u201cLong live visual anthropology, visual anthropology is dead,\u201d in American Anthropologist 100 (2), 534-537.\n Week 2: The ethnographic allegory\nFilm: Hearts and Minds (1974)\u2014Peter Davis\nReading: James Clifford, \u201cOn Ethnographic Allegory,\u201d in Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography, ed.

Subsequently, the course moves to the 21st century and analyses new technologies, such as drones, cyber systems, and other on-or-over-the-horizon technologies, such as AI, big data, and deep learning. Here it seeks to assess how these technologies will impact the current notion of military conflict. Finally, the course seeks to engage in theoretical discussion on the political, legal, ethical, and moral considerations of conflict in the past, present, and future.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\n1.

Moreover, how can we study sex anthropologically and ethically? Both in terms of male/female bodily sexes and in terms of sexual play and desire, sex has been a central concern to anthropologists since the very founding of the discipline in the late nineteenth century. This course analyzes the various aspects of sex from the perspective of two subfields of anthropology: sociocultural anthropology and linguistic anthropology. This includes but is not limited to: social and linguistic constructions of sex and gender; gendered violence; power and language; the regulation of sex; and the queering of sex. Course readings will draw broadly from both historical and contemporary work within sociocultural and linguistic anthropology, as well as critical works (theoretical and historical) in gender/sexuality studies.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of this course students should be able to:\n1. Critically identify and discuss the ways in which sex (and gender) are constructed within different social contexts\n2. Understand and apply different ethnographic research methods to a particular research question\n3. Articulate the ethics of ethnographic research, with a particular focus on gender and sex\n4.

This course looks at law from an anthropological perspective, investigating: (1) what is law in different cultures? (2) to what extent is 21st century law a culture in itself? Students will be exposed to a wide range of sociolegal scholarship with a specific focus on themes of law, social regulation, politics, and bureaucracy. By the end of the class, students will conduct and share research on a legal culture of their choosing.\n---\nMain Topics:\nUnit One: Law Before Law\nThis unit looks at sociolegal theory before the emergence of anthropology. Readings from classical texts including: Plato, Tacitus, Henry Maine, Lewis Henry Morgan, Max Weber, Karl Marx. (Taken from Reader)\n\nUnit Two: Law and Culture\nThis unit looks at early sociolegal theory beginning with Hoebel\u2019s collaborations with Franz Boas. It is structured around the formalist/substantivist debate and includes an intensive case study of Malinowski and Pritchard\u2019s studies of law in small-scale societies. Key texts include: Pritchard, Malinowski, Hoebel, Kalman (in Foblets et al).\n\nUnit Three: Law as Culture\nThis unit looks at \u201cmodern\u201d law as a form of rather than autonomous of culture.

Additionally, creative writing is also an essential subject for those who want to become professional writers. This course accumulates many skills, including reading and analyzing literary works, observations, research, along with in-depth interviews. The core of the course is to help students develop their creative writing ability, to break fears that limit their creativity, to encourage them to think out of the box, explore their favorite creative writing styles, and choose a suitable form for their works. Furthermore, contemporary social issues, historical and cultural issues of Vietnam in the context of globalization are going to be taken as the main themes of students\u2019 works. The course will be joined by both national and international experts, famous writers, who will come to share their experiences. Students will combine theoretical knowledge, including reading, analysing literary works, with practical observation gained from a field trip to find their creative materials.

        "description": "Faculty: Nguyen Thanh Trung\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\nPre-requisite: No\nReading/Writing: Intensive\n---\nCourse Description: This course aims to form the foundation for a broad theoretical and empirical knowledge of the concerns of the field of comparative politics. We will investigate the central themes, theories, concepts, and questions of the contemporary study of comparative politics and explore the main theoretical, empirical, and methodological approaches to the study of Vietnamese politics. Why do nation states vary so substantially in their political freedoms and economic performances? What are similarities and differences that Vietnam bears from a comparative perspective? This course will seek to answer these big questions by developing an understanding of key concepts, theories and political system and policies of Vietnam. The course intertwines two major parts with Part I forming the foundation of the course by introducing the history, concepts, theories, and methodologies of Comparative Politics and the other exploring the actors and processes involved in the detailed case study, Vietnam. The course has a strong discussion-centered structure. Students are expected to read the assigned materials timely and thoughtfully and be ready to discuss the content in class.\n---\nLearning Objectives: Students should be able:\nTo demonstrate a basic understanding of the relationships between individuals, actors, and processes across different political systems both historical and contemporary.\nTo facilitate and/or cultivate a sense of critical awareness of the world beyond their own.\nTo develop a stronger understanding of fundamental differences between different regime types, the relationship between politics and economic outcomes, the role of identity in politics.\nTo apply the analytical and methodological tools of comparative politics to political outcomes they want to understand and explain.\nTo use these tools to further examine the political system and policies of Vietnam. \n---\nCourse Readings:\nThere is no textbook for this course.

It could as well be deeply latent inside the personal consciousness or at the hidden corner of the social collective mind. How will those quasi-transparent and subterranean features look like when they are visualized into such a grand expressive audio-visual art form as cinema? That is the first question for examination inside this course. By zooming into Vietnamese identities on contemporary Vietnamese big screen, the course is to carry out a thorough surgery on this matter of a \u201cnation in transition\u201d (William Lim, 2001) in the complex postmodern global context. This course focuses on the identity literacy for those who would like to take it seriously on Vietnam studies and particularly those who are interested in researching them through film aesthetics. First and foremost, it examines what identity is under theoretical viewpoint as well as its major attributed components as gender, race, class, and nation. In parallel, it re-examines what Vietnamese identities have been and what are the new layers of Vietnamese identities which are being reconstructed in the contemporary epoch.\nAfter providing a brief knowledge on film aesthetics, the course will make use of those understandings to analyze and critique how contemporary Vietnamese filmmakers (of the 21st century) convey their personal as well as collective Vietnamese identities through each filmmaker\u2019s aesthetic choices. Those are not historical lessons on Vietnamese cinema since its birth but zooming into the contemporary Vietnamese film instead. More precisely, after the U.S opened the embargo with Vietnam, which opened a new chapter for the country in transition, the new epoch of Vietnamese cinema has also been opened, with a booming market and a radical of art-house and experimental genres having been emerged. For nearly thirty years, a new wave of contemporary filmmakers in Vietnam have been reinventing various aesthetic choices of the classic world cinema in order to shape a new face of Vietnamese cinema as well as Vietnamese collective identities. Hence, reading the embedded Vietnamese identities being embedded on Vietnamese big screen can\u2019t be distinguished from reading how Vietnamese cinema has been transformed aesthetically.\nBy reading theories and defining specific cases on personal and collective identities on Vietnamese cinema inside its present socio-political context, this course aims to provide students a full and well-rounded understandings on the complex Vietnamese identities at the moment. Also, by the end of this course, students are expected to grasp a more well-rounded knowledge on cinema aesthetics and the way a film\u2019s visual and aural features are used to create essentially non-narrative dimensions of film, including the film\u2019s \u2018look\u2019.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: Students in this course will:\n1. Evaluate Vietnamese identities and how contemporary Vietnamese films applying different aesthetics to convey its embedded identities.\n2. Understand the distinctions between personal, collective and national identities and how they are conveyed as a part of film politics.\n3. Explore Vietnamese complex socio-cultural materials for future courses of Vietnamese studies as well as film studies.\n4. Write critiques on films in formal academic form with full understandings of film language.\n5. Gain knowledge of the living history of contemporary Vietnamese film scene and identify conventions and elements of their aesthetics\n6. Prepare and submit their own film essays in appropriate English formal writings.\n---\nTentative Schedule:\nWeek 1: What is identity: Literature Review of identity in the postmodern context\nWeek 2: Vietnam In Transition: What are the taken-for-granted Vietnamese identities and what is the contemporary socio-political-cultural context of Vietnam that gives birth to an urgent examination of its identities?\nWeek 3: Visible identities: Gender, Race, Class, and Nation\nWeek 4: How identities are embedded inside the film language: The way a film\u2019s visual and aural features are used to create essentially non-narrative dimensions of film, including the film\u2019s \u2018look\u2019 and its identities\nWeek 5: The contemporary Vietnamese cinema inside the global film context: A reconstruction towards a new set of Vietnamese identities on screen\nWeek 6: Nationhood on Vietnamese screen: Is there still an image of One Collective Vietnamese Being?\nWeek 7: The concept of Class on Vietnamese cinema (or National Heroes vs Unnamed citizens)\nWeek 8: Masculinity vs. Feminnity vs Feminism inside a patriach culture on Vietnamese screen:\nWeek 9: Third Gender: Homosexuality and LGBT as the emerging gender of a modern Vietnamese social body.\nWeek 10: Urban Narratives in New Vietnamese cinema.\nWeek 11: Ethnic Stories and the Marginalized fates on the grand road of history\nWeek 12: Diaspora narratives in Vietnamese films from inside and outside the territory\nWeek 13: Legislative and latent Censorships: An open battlefield for claiming what should be and what should not be \u201cVietnamese\u201d on screen.\nWeek 14: Summary Deadline for SUBMISSION OF FINAL WRITTEN/VIDEO ESSAY\nReviews & Conclusion\n---\nAssessments & Grading:\nParticipation in Class Discussions and Workshops: 20%\nHomework of identity and aesthetic critiques in informal written forms every week: 20%\nGroup presentation: 20%\nFinal formal written or video essay: 40%",

Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Students will be exposed to \u201cVietnamese Studies\u201d currently practiced inside and outside Vietnam to realize which approaches have been employed in this interdisciplinary field, and how the field significantly varies in different geo-political, socio-cultural environments, depending on who is doing it and in which contexts it is carried out. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. Finally, students will have a chance to redefine \u201cVietnam Studies\u201d at Fulbright University Vietnam and figure out which directions it is heading towards. This course is open to VS majors and non-majors.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n1. Become aware of the work of leading scholars/experts from Vietnam and overseas;\n2. Contextualize Vietnam in regional/area studies;\n3.

Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\u00e2m H\u00e1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts.\nNowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular. Based on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: Having finished this course, students will:\n1. Have basic knowledge of Vietnamese Literary Chinese (writing, reading, grammar)\n2. Attain a vocabulary of 800 words of Vietnamese Literary Chinese.\n3. Gain the ability to read poems or tales in Vietnamese Literary Chinese.\n4. Establish basic understanding of Vietnamese classical literature and Vietnamese literary Chinese heritage (including Vietnamese Literary Chinese in temples, or at historical sites)\n5. Have greater appreciation of Vietnamese language and culture.\n---\nAssessments & Grading\nAttendance: 15%\nQuizzes: 15%\nMid-term: 20%\nFinal exam: 50%",

Students will be able to observe the patterns of competition, cooperation and alliance between Vietnam and the various political players in mainland Southeast Asia prior to the establishment of the Western powers. Relatively understudied period of Vietnamese history, such as the Hu\u1ebf Court\u2019s absorption of Champa in the third decade of the 19th century (1832-1835), and the assimilation of Cambodia under the Tr\u1ea5n T\u00e2y Th\u00e0nh period (1834-1847), will be explored in detail. In order to get a more nuanced approach of the events, students will have the unique opportunity be introduced to the Cham, Khmer and Siamese perspectives on the events that affected not only Champa and Cambodia, their societies, and their historical developments, but had also a deep impact on the formation of modern Vietnam.\n---\nLearning Outcomes:\n1. With a foundational grounding in history and theory, students will comprehend the broader processes of empire, political communities, transnationalism, interethnic association, and competition and apply these lessons to study other contexts in Southeast Asia and the world.\n2. Through readings, discussions, and debates, students will learn to critically analyze primary and secondary sources\n3. Students will address fundamental questions of historical change\n4.

        "description": "Visiting Faculty: Phan Dang Di\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\nPre-requisite: No\n---\nCourse Description:\nThis course offers both practical knowledge and screenwriting training. In the practical knowledge section, we will be examining the current state of film production in Vietnam (from the beginning of the 21st century until the present day) by analyzing several popular production models: state funded films, films partially subsidized and commissioned by the government, privately investments, international co-productions, foreign films shooting and hiring crews in Vietnam and independent films seeking finance from domestic and international funds. This section also provides in-depth analysis and comparison regarding different systems of public policy directed towards the cinema industry in Vietnam and other countries such as Korea, China, France and America, apparent in their regulations, development strategies and various situations of censorship. Students will be able to grasp an understanding of how a country's public policy impacts the development of its cinema. \n\nThe screenwriting exercises, which take up to 75% of the class, will guide students through the process of coming up with ideas suitable to be developed in the context of aforementioned models of production as well as their capacities. Students will be trained to present these ideas in a professional format of a comprehensive look-book that is ready to pitch to potential production companies or investors. \n\nDepending on their progress, students are encouraged to develop ideas that challenge the audience's usual watching habits, the industry's current ability to produce as well as stereotypes about Vietnamese films and censorship in order for them to optimize their imagination and creativity. We hope the students can start contemplating on their own path to materialize the ideas that are 'impossible' in the current context yet possible in the near future. \n\nThere will be two (tentative) guest speakers, Mrs. Dinh Thi Thanh Huong, Vice President of Galaxy Media & Entertainment and Director Charlie Nguyen, who will discuss with students on related topics.\n---\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to  \nRECOGNIZE that historical and cultural heritage, as well as regional and global contexts, are all essential to understanding Vietnam;  \nLISTEN, SPEAK, READ, and WRITE languages essential for understanding Vietnam, including but not limited to: classical/vernacular Chinese, N\u00f4m script, and French at CEFR Level A2 or equivalent; \nPERFORM close-readings and critical interpretations of texts and other media authored by local and international scholars, writers, and cultural producers;  \nCOMMUNICATE and COLLABORATE effectively in intercultural environments;  \nFORMULATE and CONDUCT substantial independent research projects;  \nAPPLY interdisciplinary skills and methods to address contemporary issues and become active citizens in Vietnamese society. \n---\nSyllabus\nSECTION 1 \nSession 1: Overview of film production in Vietnam from the beginning of 21st century to the present day (Lesson 1): The rapid change of the global film market perceived through the tendency of the audience, the way movies are produced and consumed, the dominance of major cinemas and their impacts on Vietnamese cinema \n+ What has Vietnamese cinema done to survive in this fiercely competitive and rapidly changing landscape? \nThe government's unsuccessful attempts to regain the dominance through state-funded productions: why did state-funded movies fail and why has this string of failures persisted to this day with no resolution?
