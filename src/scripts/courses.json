They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can also spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. The course focuses on building a skill set specific to the study of the visual realm and provides a sound foundation in relevant theories such as technologies of vision, surveillance, the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and cinema and spectatorship. This skill set is crucial to analyzing, interpreting, and historicizing various forms of art, including fine art such as painting and sculpture as well as popular art such as advertisements, film, television, and images and videos circulated on online platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.

Such approaches include connoisseurship, iconography, semiology, Marxism, feminism, poststructuralism, visual culture, and postcolonial studies. Important questions that will surface throughout our discussions include the relationship of artistic form to context, the very notion of art as history, and the possibilities and challenges of a truly 'global' art history.

We will examine the historical negotiations of major religious traditions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam, through visual, material, and performative practices, as well as gain a familiarity with how these artistic forms retain their vitality and resonance in the present, whether it be through contemporary art or in debates about national identity and cultural heritage.

The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine.  From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.", "schedule": []}, {"id": "CS302_Spring2021_S01", "type": "Quarter 3", "title": "Theory of Computing", "credits": 4, "instructor": "Hung Son Nguyen", "start_date": "11/1/2021", "end_date": "26/03/2021", "capacity": 25, "description": "\u2022 Level: Advanced\n\u2022 Prerequisites: CS 101 \u2013 Computer Science 1 and CS 201 \u2013 Computer Science 2 and MATH 102 \u2013 Discrete Mathematics\n\u2022 Course Format: Online\n\u2022 Note: This is a major course in the theory area of Computer Science major. \n\u2022 Details: Sometime in middle school, you were taught how to multiply and add large numbers.

Drawing from fiction, film, memoir, news articles, poems, cartoons, and historical and feminist works, we will analyze women\u2019s contributions to warfare in the following roles: as mothers, nurses, wives, resistance fighters, base workers, sex workers, war brides, anti-war protestors, journalists, humanitarians, soldiers, and political leaders. Students taking this course will gain a deeper appreciation of Vietnamese and U.S. women\u2019s history and the issues surrounding women\u2019s portrayals as nurturers, breeders, protected others, betrayers, victims, consumers, sexual provocateurs, and woman warriors. Through class discussions, presentations, and writing assignments, students will develop skills to critically interpret women\u2019s real and fantasized relationships to modern wars. Students will also develop a vocabulary in gender and feminist studies through the applied use of terms and concepts like gender construction, differences between gender and sex, gender performance, gender non-conformity, intersectionality, interpellations between societal gender and war structures, and the mobilization of gendered identities for militarized purposes in the U.S. and Vietnam during the Vietnam War Era.

One can wake up, grab their phone, catch up with news and friends from around the world, all before leaving the bed.  For all humans spending their lives in towns, villages, and cities, from one side of the world to another, most of us spend much of our lives in cyberspace.  The meaning of \u201cgoing there\u201d has changed, and the Internet is fundamental to that change. We log into the Internet, go online, visit websites, surf the web, navigate pages, and so forth.  Even the language we use to talk about the Internet is one of travel, of spatial belonging and exploration. This course considers how the Internet, and in particular, online communities and cyberspace are redefining what it means to be human.  As much as this is a course about digital belonging, this is also a course of digital belonging.  Through a reflexive analysis of our digital connectivity within the class, we can challenge our own assumptions about what it means to exist in digital spaces.  Some online spaces we will explore are: Social Media Influencers, E-Sports, Online Forums (including parenting, suicide, and dating), Hacktivism, Wikipedia, and, of course, Facebook. Some theoretical concepts we explore are social theories of modernization, materiality, actor network theory, social capital, identity, space, virtuality, the state, and surveillance. This course offers a general introduction to social science and anthropological research methods, and theories, with a specific emphasis on cultures of and in new media (internet, mobile phone, etc.).

Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability.  Human language is not just about communication. Words, to quote JL Austin, \"do things\".  Phrases like, \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  Language is intimately tied to experience, were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d?, or an insult?  Ultimately, as much as language is something that humans make, language is also part of what makes us human.  This course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology.  Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics.  These concepts include linguistic relativity, code, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing.  In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. These themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.  Please note, this is not a linguistics course.  We will not be learning new languages or the technical components of syntactic structures. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as core texts will be in English and many draws upon English for examples.", "schedule": []}, {"id": "VS201_Spring2021_S01", "type": "Semester", "title": "Going Hand in Hand: Politics and Economic Development in Contemporary Vietnam", "credits": 4, "instructor": "Nguyen Thanh Trung", "start_date": "11/1/2021", "end_date": "28/05/2021", "capacity": 30, "description": "\u2022 Level: Intermediate\n\u2022 Prerequisites: \n\u2022 Reading/Writing Intensive\n\u2022 Course Format: In-person\n\u2022 Details: To help Vietnam become an active participant in today\u2019s world requires a basic understanding of the country and the broader Asia-Pacific region.
